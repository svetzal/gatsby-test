  <title>How to answer "What's wrong with PHP?"</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I spec'd a new project the other day. Nothing new, we do this all the time, probably a few dozen times a year. We went through the usual round of analysis, what kinds of people would use the system, what screens would it have, and what entities (types of data) it would need. In the end we settled on the amount of time each element would take, compiled up a total estimate, and created a proposal for the customer.

Throughout the process, as often happens, there was a conversation like this.
<ul>
	<li>"The customer has mentioned PHP, it seems simple enough to do in PHP on the surface."</li>
	<li>"Yeah, but what about XYZ - last time we did that we got hosed by their host's PHP settings."</li>
	<li>"Sure, but we can get that information up-front."</li>
	<li>"Yeah, but there's a lot of fields here. I'd like to give Symphony a shot." (Symphony is a PHP framework)</li>
	<li>"We can't do that. Symphony requires PHP5, and PHP was chosen so they can work with regular shared hosting, and shared hosting providers don't generally offer PHP5."</li>
	<li>"They will by next year, PHP4 will no longer be supported after December."</li>
	<li>"They need to host it this year though. We could get them to specify PHP5 when looking for hosting. Wait-a-sec, if we're going to require them to obtain specialized hosting, why don't we just use Rails?"</li>
	<li>"Hells yeah, that would work."</li>
</ul>
And lo, the project became a Rails project instead of PHP.

So, what caused the conversation to go this way?

I've been programming PHP for years. Don't much like it. Why do I keep doing it? In the end, every time we look at it, the ONLY reason we ever do a project in PHP is because it's part of a web site and must be supported in a shared hosting environment. That's it. None of our developers enjoy working with PHP - it's poorly documented, quirky, and nearly impossible to debug.

Why is it so popular? It all comes down to PHP itself and the community that thrives on it. Most web projects are small projects, with little actual programming. PHP developers can get by with a little syntax and some basic programming constructs like conditionals, loops, and function calls. Hosting providers can simply pick the off-the-shelf control panel software on which to run their business, and it supports PHP. It's the lowest common denominator in the hosting market.

PHP supports few useful programming idioms. It doesn't support the simplest of object-oriented constructs, never mind the tremendously time saving constructs such as the mix-ins or continuations you get in Ruby. In fact, I'd estimate in PHP4 I get to use maybe 20% of my programming bag-of-tricks.

As a result, it's a "good enough" technology for most. It "gets the job done", and it's reasonably simple to work on (though if I see one more fool programming PHP live on their production web environment I'm gonna scream).

<strong>So, what if you're not happy with "good enough"?</strong>

That's where we're at. We're <em>not</em> happy with "good enough", and "good enough" is certainly not what we want for our customers.

So, it turns out we may lose this project because it's too expensive, and too hard to host. It's too bad, because it would have been superb.]]></content:encoded>

I agree, it normally would.

However in this case, it's a matter of required effort and code volume. It's like building a house with a hammer. At some point, you need a saw, and probably a few other tools to get the job done in a reasonable time. And in the world of commercial software development, getting things done in a reasonable time is money the customer didn't have to spend, or even better, money in your pocket.

In the end, I wish the hosting market wasn't in the terribly dismal state that it's in. I'd like to be able to recommend PHP5, or Rails, or Java without jumping through hoops.

I guess if hammers are $1, and saws are $1,000 a lot of people are going to try to cut wood with their hammers. Doesn't mean it's a good idea :)]]></wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I agree with the lowest common denominator scenario.  It sounds bad but PHP is generally adopted by non-programmers because "It's easy! Anyone can do it".  That's great that it has a low entry point and that people are encouraged to try programming.  Contrary to the current trend however, popularity does not make something better.  It does however tend to push people toward whatever the "hip" new thing is and that's where we currently are.  Only getting to use 20% of your "bag of tricks" is not necessarily a good thing.  Would Superman be a better Superhero if he only got to use 20% of his power?

I don't know about anyone else but I think I'll use the tools required to build my house; custom tools where decent ones don't currently exist.]]></wp:comment_content>

  <title>Communicate on Their Terms</title>
  <link>https://svetzal.wordpress.com/2007/08/23/communicate-on-their-terms/</link>

  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Why are there so many form letters in the world? Pointless advertising inserts?

Communicating with customers with a form letter is like communicating on your terms. They don't get to see anything that truly relates to them. So you insert your latest ad campaign, and hope for the best.

Customers are wise to this, they recognize a form letter in an instant. If you talk to them, they probably don't mind an automated piece of correspondence, but they probably do mind if you haven't treated them with respect.

How do you treat them with respect?
<ul>
	<li>be short and to the point, you've already interrupted their day, it better be good</li>
	<li>if they aren't eligible for a promotion, don't mention it</li>
	<li>show them only promotions in which they personally might be interested</li>
	<li>show them only product tips for products they actually own</li>
	<li>make the correspondence an integral part of a regular mailing like their bill or account statement
<ul>
	<li>don't make it an insert -- it'll just get trashed</li>
	<li>customers can opt-out of other correspondence, but they can't opt out of their bill</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
Communicating with your customers on their terms is important to good customer relations. The more you understand your customer's personal preferences and current product mix, the better you can position the most likely successful up-sell. The more you understand how they use products they own, the more likely you can point out useful tips to them.

Sometimes this can get complicated, but it doesn't have to. If you're a small business running Quickbooks, group your customers by their profile into separate invoice runs and customize your Quickbooks invoice templates to target each group. If you have a lot of customers, you might want to look into Automated Correspondence software.

So, next time you think about using a form letter to inform your customers about something, go the extra step and customize it at least for your most common customer groupings.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I was reading <a href="http://www.tylercruz.com/the-rarest-commodity-the-programmer/" target="_blank">this post</a> the other day and thinking about my particular challenges with software developers. Which I believe I have some insight into, actually being a developer myself. Also my company is not a web design company, so our technologies and requirements are a little different.

It's natural I think for people to want to categorize developers, but I've found that particularly difficult. I find there are individual traits that seem to stand out, but no particular stereotype by which to categorize.

One trait that stands out, that in my mind separates the great developers from the not-so-great ones is a drive to learn. Truly, once you have sufficiently advanced in any field you begin to see that it will be impossible for you to learn enough to get by in general terms. So you begin developing vertical depth of knowledge on topics as you work on specific projects.

Good developers thrive on this. They get into a topic, and you can see them enjoying themselves. They experiment, scour for resources, experiment some more. Their project runs longer than they expected.  They talk about their problems all the time, and talk about how cool the technology is they used to solve them, or how cool their approach was.

I don't worry much when things go long. I try to build some of that in to our project timelines, but in the end in this fast moving field I'm happy the developers have picked up a shiny new set of skills. And I think they're happy to be in an environment that embraces learning and professional development rather than being pressured into yet another impossible deadline.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Speak Clearly from Experience</title>
  <link>https://svetzal.wordpress.com/2007/09/05/speak-clearly-from-experience/</link>

  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[So today I'm working through some more content management challenges - and hating JavaScript-based WYSIWYG editors. They really really suck.The main reason they do, are they all simply expose HTML editing capabilities from within the browser. Unfortunately, this is typically buggy and extremely clunky. If you don't believe me, try table editing. Ugh.

On the Three Wise Men CMS system I overcame this by licensing a fabulous Applet based editor from Ephox. I like it so much, I continually try to work it into other projects. The only issue is that it's expensive (well that's a relative term, with our CMS product the WYSIWYG editor used to be <strong>our largest tech-support call driver</strong>!), so you have to have a strong business model behind the web-app. In the end, however, our users have thanked us, over and over again.

You really can't understand this until you compare the JavaScript and Ephox editors. Edit some tables. Appreciate simple things like your cursor maintaining position when you switch between source-view and WYSIWYG view. The spell-checker. It's really hard to go back.

Trouble is selling customers on this. They really don't understand this until they suffer the experience of a JavaScript based editor. In fact, even then a lot of people haven't <em>really</em> spent enough time in the editor to understand the absolutely horrible things it's doing to their content. Try pasting in Word content from your typical user's Word doc (you know, those docs where people use spaces and extra carriage returns to line text up, and have 30 different font sizes used in random places throughout). You'll begin to understand what I mean.

Really this is like a lot of technology, when customers don't know you, they don't know to trust your judgement. All the experience in the world on your side won't help if you can't argue your point convincingly.

So sharpen that saw, try to find ways to explain things your experience has taught you in a way that customers can understand. It's worth it.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Unit Testing: It's About Confidence</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I was reading <a href="http://www.deaded.com/staticpages/index.php/whywritetestcode">this post</a>, which raises some interesting points, but it sidesteps what I believe is the absolutely <strong>most important reason</strong> to unit test.

As a developer, when I change code I have a mental model of what I'm affecting. The larger the project, the longer ago I worked on it, or any additional team members contributing code means that my mental model strays further and further from reality.

Unit tests are a hard-shot of reality.

They are a huge banging klaxon that my mental model is not quite aligned, and the code that I just wrote bent reality beyond acceptable tolerance.

Without this, my confidence in the code I've written begins to waver. I think it will work, because in my own mental model it does work. However I know the fallacies of my own mental models.

Watch someone who isn't confident in what they are doing.

They go slowly, more slowly than they have to. They interrupt their work constantly to double-check (often manually) that things are still working. This can take a 30 minute programming task and turn it into a 4 hour marathon.

This is why unit testing is the simplest and most important tool in any developer's arsenal.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Using "Open Source" Commercially</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I've been writing recently, mostly because our <a href="http://threewisemen.ca">ThreeWiseMen.ca</a> website needs an overhaul for content.

Three Wise Men is my software development company. The core product offering is professional software development services. For about 15 years I've personally been leveraging open-source software components to accelerate development of personal and professional projects, and I've been rattling around in my head a good way to put what I do onto paper in understandable terms (remember my post the other week).

Reconciling the concept of software developed in an open community, utilized by highly proprietary and private commercial firms takes some getting used to.

I think I've been on most sides of the fence.

While none of the original software I've written under an open-source license has become popular, it was written to alleviate pain felt in the commercial space. I don't believe it can become popular simply because it doesn't solve a common enough problem, and while it was original it was not strictly unique.

I've contributed in various ways over the years directly and indirectly to popular (and some not-so-popular) open-source projects. But what does it mean to contribute?
<ul>
	<li>Use it</li>
	<li>Talk about it with your social community (friends, customers, etc)</li>
	<li>Send feedback or questions to the mailing lists</li>
	<li>Respond to feedback or questions on the mailing lists</li>
	<li>Write or correct documentation for it (hopefully they use a wiki, or send content to the committers)</li>
	<li>Fix problems, send patches to the committers (the person or people who manage the official open-source distribution)</li>
	<li>Become a committer</li>
</ul>
Many people don't go much beyond the "Use it" stage, which I believe is still a significant and tangible contribution to the project by raising it's popularity or number of users. "Talk about it" is actually a short step up, if you don't open conversation you can certainly continue a conversation about it.

<strong>Use it Because They Want You To</strong>

People contributing to open-source projects have all kinds of motivations. In my experience, however, one thing has held true - developers like to be proud of their work. Whether they're getting paid to contribute by a sponsor, or whether they contribute in their spare time,  they do this because they like to, something drives them to it, and it's satisfying when they are successful.

You're not abusing them, you're not extorting them, they (the individuals and sponsors) choose to do what they do. Usually because they have some private or commercial gain from their work. If you can too, more power to you.

Sometimes I've seen contributors take on attitudes, not unlike the attitudes that can sometimes develop within corporate IT. I'm not entirely sure the underlying reason there, but I expect it's because they're overwhelmed, aren't receiving the help they need to do a "proper job". That's a pretty broad brush-stroke, but I don't think I'm too far outside the lines.

<strong>Use it Because They Know What They're Doing</strong>

One of my favourite ideas I originally heard from <a href="http://www.webmink.net/minkblog.htm">Simon Phipps</a>, who attributes <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Joy">Bill Joy</a>. It's the idea that you can't hire all the good people.  They're just not available to you. A great example of this is the Apache Lucene project.

Go to the Lucene <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/who.html">project management committee</a> page, google the names you find there. You'll find some really smart folks that you'd love to have on your team, but they're all over the world, often employed, and just simply unavailable. But they know their stuff.

<strong>Use it Because It Makes You Harder / Better / Faster / Stronger</strong>

Pardon the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cYWfq--Nw">Daft Punk</a>, but this is what you want in a commercial venture. You want an edge, or at least not to be disadvantaged when others have this edge.

You want fewer bugs. You want more features. You want better optimization. You want more flexibility. So do your customers.

<strong>Use it WHEN the License Says You Can</strong>

The only thing to watch is the various open-source licenses. There's a reason there are so many - there are as many as there are motivations for building code.

GPL is great when you intend to give back to the community, other licenses like Apache, BSD, even LGPL are good if you want to simply leverage and embed open-source code in your own projects.

<strong>So there you have it,</strong> don't be afraid but be aware, and enjoy the tremendous wealth of open-source projects out there.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>End User Experience - Why, Microsoft, why?</title>
  <link>https://svetzal.wordpress.com/2007/09/16/end-user-experience-why-microsoft-why/</link>

  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I recently purchased a new laptop for one of my daughters, it came with Vista. This is the first Vista based computer in the house.

Let me give you a little background on me. I own a couple Macs, I'm an avid Linux user, and I've extensively used every prior version of Windows. We currently have 7 computers in the house (below average for us). I run a software development company. The end-user experience of any product is very important to me.

Why isn't it important to Microsoft?

I've just observed the absolute worst end-user experience I've ever seen, a convoluted sequence of events that would turn any new user off using computers (or at least Vista) forever.

So, my daughter wants to install her favourite game - Diablo II. She inserts the install CD, and is immediately blocked with a complex dialog concerning autorun, I wasn't quick enough to record the text therein, but it provided no good direction as to what to do. I had her select "always autoplay" because I believe this is helpful for novice users, and saves them having to figure out how to open Explorer and navigate to the CD to run the setup manually.

Prior to Vista, this would have been it. From here on in, the installer would have been the end-user's sole interaction during the install process, and it would have been relatively smooth.

Instead there was a rediculously complex set of interactions interrupting the process:

With each disc she inserts (Diablo II is 3 CD-ROMs), a dialog box prompts asking whether it should run SETUP.EXE on that disc. The options are simply "Cancel, I don't know where this program is from or what it's for." or "Allow, I trust this program. I know where it's from or I've used it before." are the two options available. She selects "Allow" because she wants the program to install.

Shortly after this she gets another dialog stating "This program might not have installed correctly" (the installer has not yet completed, but is still running) She's prompted to either "Reinstall using recommended settings", or "This program installed correctly". There's also a cancel button, which I direct her to use, but no regular person could possibly guess that from the dialog presented and the overarching operation they're trying to accomplish.

All in all, instead of watching the install dialog, swapping disks when prompted (there are 4 disc swaps), her experience is thus:
<ol>
	<li>Insert the first CD, allow Autoplay</li>
	<li>Click to install Diablo II</li>
	<li>Diablo II prompts to insert a disc</li>
	<li>Windows prompts to run SETUP on that disk, accept is chosen</li>
	<li>Windows complains that SETUP has failed, cancel is chosen</li>
	<li>Diablo II prompts to insert a disc</li>
	<li>Windows prompts to run SETUP on that disk, accept is chosen</li>
	<li>Windows complains that SETUP has failed, cancel is chosen</li>
	<li>Diablo II prompts to insert a disc</li>
	<li>Windows prompts to run SETUP on that disk, accept is chosen</li>
	<li>Windows complains that SETUP has failed, cancel is chosen</li>
	<li>Diablo II prompts to insert a disc</li>
	<li>Windows prompts to run SETUP on that disk, accept is chosen</li>
	<li>Windows complains that SETUP has failed, cancel is chosen</li>
	<li> Seup finally completes</li>
</ol>
By the end of the process, my daughter was beginning to pick up on what was going on and asked why it complained each time that the setup had failed. Visibly frustrated, she shook her hands in exasperation.
Now if I sit down and analyze this, it makes a certain kind of sense. Blizzard puts SETUP on each disc, because they want to be able to direct the end user towards the correct installation process regardless of what disc they insert. Autoplay triggers on this, and Accept allows it to run, but it terminates because the other install is in progress, which Microsoft errantly considers an installation failure.

Of course, she could probably have cancelled Windows from running SETUP on each disc insert to stop Windows believing setup failed each time, but Windows doesn't make it clear that SETUP was launched as a result of autorun and it seemed contrary to her desired action (install the game).

The best installation process I've seen is what is often done on the Mac, and it isn't an installer. Mac programs can be completely contained behind a single icon, dragged from drive to drive in their entirety and retaining integrity regardless of where it's placed. That's because the icon you see represents the folder in which the software and all its resources are installed.  In fact, some users are amused by the common practice for Mac distributions to simply place the application's icon beside an alias to the computer's Applications folder - directing the user to simply drag the icon on top of the folder to "install" which in reality is just the normal file move/copy gesture.

Microsoft has created a terrible place for end-users to live, and with each release of Windows they make it worse. How much of this will the world take?]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Keep It Simple, (Not So) Stupid</title>
  <link>https://svetzal.wordpress.com/2007/09/23/keep-it-simple-not-so-stupid/</link>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Have you tried this? I mean really, sat down, tried to make something simple. Not simple for you, simple for others.

People always say they want simple. They go on and on about the last thing they had / did / bought and how complicated it was. And simple should cost less right?

When building software at <a href="http://threewisemen.ca">Three Wise Men</a>, we try to always focus initially on "the smallest possible thing that will work." It gets us out the gate with something that we can build on as we discover what "simple" actually means for each client.

I think what people are actually asking for when they say "simple" is "intuitive", which is very subjective. Intuition is born of a lifetime of experience. Luckily, we all live on the same rock so we should be able to draw upon some common themes.

Within a particular discipline, let's take Software Development, our experience working with software is quite common. However I think it's funny to use the inanely complex user interfaces and interactions of the past to make things easier for people moving forward. Take printing from Word Perfect. Just press F7. It's simple - unless you're not one of the diligent few who memorized the keyboard layout for Word Perfect. Yet, I hear people say things like "we should all just go back to Word Perfect, it was so much simpler."

Step back and look at the vast majority of people's interactions with their computer. They fight with it constantly. They <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLCoYrmZwk">do things out of frustration</a>. Ok, well maybe we don't all get physically violent but I bet you've flown the F sharp more than once if you spend any time around computers. Do we really want to build new interfaces on top of this legacy?

I think we're still at the stage with computers (and electronics in general) where we're inventing simplicity from scratch nearly every time. Sure, there are some individual lessons learned you can build from, but no big shiny strategy. Even Apple hasn't seemed to keep up with their <a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/OSXHIGuidelines/index.html">Human Interface Guidelines</a> work, or maybe they've just stopped documenting it. Despite next to none of our applications being run on Apple's OS X, I still use many good examples from that guide because they simply (no pun intended!) make sense.

I listened to <a href="http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/view/id/172">this podcast</a> the other day, and I think it sums up a lot. John Maeda does an excellent talk on simplicity and its complexity, and our seeming addiction to it. In fact, his book and <a href="http://lawsofsimplicity.com/category/laws?order=ASC">web site</a> are very much worth a look if you're challenged to attain simplicity.

One more step forward :)]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Life is a learning exercise.

I have two contrasting projects on my mind right now that are at different stages of complexity, although they're somewhat related.

First, through FreshSand Ventures we're putting a lot of effort into <a href="http://easybrandingtools.com/">EasyBrandingTools.com</a> hoping to grow that business. We've been struggling to identify how to reach our target audience but we know a fair bit about them. Simplicity is key for us here, if we don't have it, we won't grow. EasyBrandingTools.com provides a coordinated website, email, business cards and letterhead for new businesses for a small monthly subscription fee.

Second,  through <a href="http://threewisemen.ca/">Three Wise Men</a> we're putting a lot of effort into the <a href="http://threewisemen.ca/article.php?id=AK6-3C">Wise Communicator</a> product. I fear that this product will never be simple. It's very technical and will always require a developer to integrate it. Wise Communicator ingests data, runs it through a set of rules, and then generates a variety of output such as emails, printed materials, and dynamic graphics. You could think of it as mail-merge on steroids, or an email broadcast engine, except that it can generate as complex materials as your rules and data allow - which (for most organizations) is insanely complex. So, this can sometimes require a person with a brain the size of Manhattan to wrestle under control.

It's interesting that EasyBrandingTools.com is a very complex animal, with some sophisticated technology, yet we wrestled the complexity of the technology into some very simple use cases. So for the end-users, it's trivial. <a href="https://easybrandingtools.com/freecards">Fill out a form, get some business cards</a>.

We have decided that this is the same path we are going to take with our Wise Communicator product - creating, packaging and selling specialized products using it as a foundation but providing a series of pre-built use-cases that can be simple for end-users.

The nice thing about this, is that for each use-case we narrow our target audience. We have a sharp focus which will help our sales and marketing efforts tremendously.

All while re-using, strengthening, and growing the core technology - which will help to drive additional features to the specialized products.

I love my job :)]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Lies, Damned Lies, and Software Development Estimates</title>
  <link>https://svetzal.wordpress.com/2007/10/06/lies-damned-lies-and-software-development-estimates/</link>

  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Yes, that might be an odd headline for me to make, given that I actually run a software development company.

Or is it.

I was catching up on my little corner of the blogosphere and finally arrived at Reg's <a href="http://weblog.raganwald.com/2007/06/which-theory-first-evidence.html">most recent post</a> on  theory D, theory P and his subsequent <a href="http://weblog.raganwald.com/2007/10/d-is-for-doh-we-should-have-gone-with-p.html">follow up</a>.

Theory D people are those who believe that software development is a Deterministic field, and Theory P people are those who believe that software development is a Probabilistic field. Theory D people believe that you can calculate deterministically the effort required for any given software development project. Theory P people believe that it's a more organic process where needs and desires drive the outcomes. Take a look at Reg's posts for some background on this -- it's OK, I'll wait...

...ok, so here's my thing. I believe everyone starts as a Theory D person, regardless of the field. To an onlooker, it's hard to see the complexity of a field especially when observing an expert. And as humans, I believe we have a tendency to underestimate the complex as a survival mechanism. If we really understood how hard it is to do something, we may never try and we would not advance.

Consider the idea that <em>the more you learn, the less you know</em>. The highest formal educational designation you can attain is a PhD, which is a Doctor of Philosophy. Your understanding of your field moves from the Deterministic to the Probabilistic, the physical as well as the metaphysical, where you must argue your theories with the rigor of the scientific process and human creativity rather than a calculator.

The more you learn about software development, the more you migrate towards being a Theory P person.

I believe this is one of the key challenges of being in the Software Development Professional Services business. You are perpetually teaching people along the road from Theory D to Theory P.

So back to my shamelessly sensationalist headline. Why do we continue to do software development estimates?

It all comes down to the fact that software, in the end, must perform a very practical and ultimately mundane function. A function that may be perceived as simple to the stakeholders. And that function must be in place in order for the rest of their business to function. It is an imperative.

As a business imperative with an associated cost, the cost must be justified. The business must make the decision whether it will profit from or lose to the imperative which is a direct relation to its cost. A low-cost project will be easier to justify than one with a large price tag.

While the professional services salesperson tries to illustrate value to the prospect, the prospect is focused on the imperative which appears simple, and the two negotiate whether the project is feasible and at what cost.

This is where I apply my favourite question, "What is the smallest simplest possible thing we can build that will still meet the majority of your needs?".

The reason this is my favourite question is two-fold:
<ol>
	<li>we do iterative development, and we're looking to start small, deliver quickly, and do future projects to build on it</li>
	<li>small projects are easier to estimate because they have fewer factors affecting them, and you can approach a level of understanding that's aligned more closely to what's going on in Theory D people's heads</li>
</ol>
I will rarely estimate beyond the first 1-2 iterations. There is simply too much uncertainty beyond this point. Sometimes I will steer discussion towards a larger target budget, but there are no promises other than my team will work hard in the best interest of the customer, and deliver useful software at each iteration.

If pushed further, I move to a risk based model. If I'm going to take on the risk of someone else's project, they're going to get an estimate that reflects that. The bigger my risk, the more expensive the project. This is no different than the insurance industry. Now you wanna talk non-deterministic... :)]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Yeah, you heard me. I love those sensationalist headlines.

I've been frustrated lately trying to bring some associates along in their web development practices. For those getting started now in web development, please don't try and climb the long road of discovery to good web development practices along the path that I and so many others have taken.

Take the new road.

You see, the technique of sanitizing your input <em>assumes that it must be sanitized</em>. It assumes that you are constructing code (be it a SQL statement or other) from input provided by an end user, who may or may not be trying to hack your application. In this post, I'm focusing on database interfacing.

Modern application frameworks have taken this burden away from you, so please use them.

Hopefully, you're using a web framework that does this for you internally. Some programming environments (ie. PHP) are stuck in the land of eternal santization because they don't support the more sophisticated database binding technologies. If you're using a framework in an environment like PHP, you must take care - do you have projects out there using old exploitable versions of frameworks?

Let's dig further.
Modern database interfaces typically have the concept of bound variables. Bound variables are 100% safe, because the executed code is STATICALLY DEFINED in your app, and the variables are passed in separately.

So you can issue statements like this: "select * from users where id=:id", where ":id" is a place-holder to be defined separately.

I'll use discreet PHP for the first example. Consider the following three pieces of code:
<pre>// BAD!
$v = $REQUEST['myparam'];
$explode_me = mysql_query("select * from users where id='".$v."'");</pre>
<pre>// Dangerous
$v = $REQUEST['myparam'];
$v = my_magic_sanitizer($v); // hope you've thought of everything!
$please_dont_explode = mysql_query("select * from users where id='".$v."'");</pre>
<pre>// To my knowledge, the best you can do in PHP
$v = $REQUEST['myparam'];
$v = mysql_real_escape_string($v);
$probably_safe = mysql_query("select * from users where id='".$v."'");</pre>
Notice that the best you can accomplish in PHP is a dynamic SQL statement using the MySQL sanitizer, mysql_real_escape_string().

Here's the absolute best you can do (I'll use Java JPA as an example, but many environments provide this ability)
<pre>// Java
List users = pm.createQuery("SELECT u FROM Users u WHERE name=:name")
                 .setParameter("name", request.getParameter("name"))
                 .getResultList();</pre>
Notice that we can simply pass the request parameter directly into the database call. It's 100% guaranteed safe. Here's a similar example in Ruby with SQLLite:
<pre>// Ruby
db.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE name=:name", "name" =&gt; param['name'])</pre>
<strong>There's another side-benefit of this technique</strong>, and that's a feature few people pay attention to until they realize their application doesn't scale well. Statement Caching is an automated caching technique used by your database to save it having to parse through the text of your queries every single time you execute them.

If you always use dynamic statements in your application, you rarely benefit from Statement Caching.

However if you use other environments and the techniques I've shown you above, you can gain significant performance (depending on the rest of your application) through your databases Statement Cache. Prepared statements are closely related to statement caching, except you are in control over what is cached.

If you are using a framework such as CakePHP or Ruby On Rails the task of looking up items based on their id or primary key is taken care of by the framework, so you don't typically build statements anyways.

Happy coding...]]></content:encoded>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Parameterized SQL is absolutely a must. Sneaky testers will even have scripts at their disposal which will find instances in the code they are working on where 'Thou shalt not build queries dynamically' is violated.

There are other reasons to 'sanitize' all data from the client though than just (first order) SQL Injection.
- second order sql injection (where nasty things get put into the database to be run later (usually in a c/blob)
- XSS
- business rule validation
- general data quality (according to cnn a couple years back, this is one 'area of specialization that will become of greater importance over the next 10 years')
- preventing unnecessary database calls

And of course, you have to do these checks in multiple places. Doing them in the browser prevents the system from doing things that could not possibly have a chance of working but those are all html or javascript based and easily avoided through tools like firebug and tamper data. So you have to do them at the app layer as well where (in theory) they cannot be avoided. And if that physical machine is compromised (to allow them to change the rules) then you've lost the game anyways.

It's not paranoia if they really are after you.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.subfurther.com/blog/?p=34">This post</a> set me off today.

Apparently, because I want a modern Java on my Mac, I'm being selfish. Actually more specifically I'm being a "whiny little bitch".

I bought my MacBook Pro on the promise that Jobs made that said Java would be well supported under OS-X. My business depends on me and our other developers building Java applications for our customers. For nearly a year now, our Mac based developers have held back our company's ability to deliver Java 6 compliant applications because of the computer that we chose.

So it appears I've made the wrong decision to buy a Macintosh? Apple does not want my support / business?

You want to know how Apple will make more money by including Java 6? The answer is simple.

Include Java 6 and you won't lose the support of companies like mine.

If I'm not running OS-X there's little incentive for me to look at any of Apple's shiny APIs - they're pointless. Keep me on the platform and you might have a chance. Core Animation might be the most amazing thing in the world, but if you're unable to entice developers into using it (say because we all switched back to Windows / Linux) <em>it's completely irrelevant</em>.

The Mac has always been a niche platform, with a small but dedicated and vocal community. Apple began making inroads into the corporate development community, and may have just blown it in one fell swoop.

I don't want to move, but my ability to do business is far more important to me than loyalty to the Apple brand.

Come on Apple, don't let us down.]]></content:encoded>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Regarding the subject line...yes you are.

Your grandstanding is ridiculous. "Apple...may have just blown it in one fell swoop." is laughable and downright wrong. The article that "set you off" is absolutely right. Hell, if you really wanted to have Java6 you could just install Parallels and Linux or Windows in a VM (which is super easy to do) and off you go. 

I am scratching my head as to why Apple hasn't said a thing about Java. It doesn't in any way make me bemoan the lack of Java6 in Leopard (which was NEVER promised btw).

I am also hoping as in previous incarnations that Java6 will come out shortly. The pulling of the beta to "me" seems to indicate that it is.]]></wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Grandstanding gets things noticed. Same with whining :) that's why children are so good at it. There's a whole community here that is demanding attention and we need Apple to notice before business requirements truly demand we ditch this platform.

I already run VMware, Windows, Linux etc. Developing in a VM is inconvenient at best. Bootcamp works well.

Java6 in Leopard was never promised, but first-class Java support in OS-X was. The slope has long since tilted, the worst so far was when they started discontinuing Java bindings to various APIs. I believe QTJava was a blow, it had so much room to improve and filled a huge gap.

I don't know whether the answer is to have better consumer Java apps (clearly Apple favours the consumer). Frankly that doesn't affect me at all.

I couldn't care less about Limewire or any of the other java examples spouted about, and neither could my customers. They want line-of-business apps that can be put together quickly and efficiently, and Java does that very well for us...]]></wp:comment_content>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[So my ranting continues. My friend is adamantly refusing to change his Servlet/JSP habits and I'm afraid I have to take it out on everyone else around me.

A few days ago I posted a short ditty on protecting yourself from SQL injection attacks. So now you have a nice shiny database tier that's being managed by Hibernate / ActiveRecord / CakePHP / etc. You're protected from SQL injection attacks. That's all you need right?

Not a chance. As my associate <a href="http://adam.goucher.ca/">Adam Goucher</a> commented on my previous post, what about XSS or the other myriad of attacks against you or your visitors that can happen by simply echoing data to a web browser or twiddling GET/POST parameters?

Say you have a text input field that allows someone to embed a &lt;script&gt; tag and some nasty JavaScript?  Then you simply display that same input back to the user? Consider this:
<pre>&lt;?php

$var = $_POST['field'];

?&gt;

...

&lt;?= $var ?&gt;</pre>
Now you've just written extra code onto your web page that could facilitate anything from keyboard snooping to stealing cookies or displaying fake password prompts... basically a whole world of nasty.

Some web frameworks will help you with this kind of problem - even back in the days of Java JSTL whenever you output data to the screen using: &lt;c:out value="${myvar}"/&gt; the default behaviour was to escape anything that might look like HTML.

<em>Be careful though; newer frameworks don't necessarily help you here - take Rails for example. You'd better be escaping your own data.</em>

What has become popular (and I believe is a fantastic practice) in the Java world is web form data-binding. Basically you take a variable in your code and "bind" it to a control. Like this JSF example:
<pre>&lt;h:inputText value="#{address.city}"/&gt;</pre>
This creates a form text input field and simply binds the control to the city property of the address object. Say this is a form allowing a user to change their address. Gone are the days of marshalling endless fields through GET or POST back into the object - the object is bound, the framework does this for you. In your code, you just save it. That's it.

<em>Again, the Rails framework does only a little bit to help, as long as you've named your fields and form input names following the appropriate conventions. You're still stuck copying attributes from your params array back into your objects - but thankfully it's now just one line of code. Personally I like <strong>zero</strong> lines of code better :) </em>

You see, here's the rub. The more lines of code you write, the more likely there will be errors. And the more boilerplate code you write, the more likely you're copying and pasting it, which also increases the likelihood of errors.

Reduce the number of lines in your code, use an appropate web framework, and take advantage of automated safeguards where you can.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Saw <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2007/11/07/mlb-rips-off-fans-wh.html">this post</a> on Boing Boing today.

&lt;shaking head&gt;

To-date I haven't had a problem with DRM'd content that I've purchased online (I have only bought content through iTunes). Of course in Canada we can't buy movies or TV shows on iTunes (grumble grumble) so perhaps I'm not a frequent enough user to get burned.

However the more people shift to online content purchases, the more crap you're going to see here with companies seeming to care more about their supplier relationships than their customers. Or legally beaten into caring more. Hard to tell the inside story.

Interesting to see this in the wake of some recent postings by Michael Geist on some <a href="http://www.michaelgeist.ca/content/view/2358/125/">optimism in the Canadian music industry</a>, and <a href="http://www.michaelgeist.ca/content/view/2347/125/">his older posting</a> on the <a href="http://strategis.ic.gc.ca/epic/site/ippd-dppi.nsf/en/h_ip01456e.html">new Canadian study</a> showing some tenuous correlation between frequent downloaders and frequent purchasers.

DRM is a bad idea. Crippleware software is a bad idea. Come on people. You don't have to be a socialist, you <em>can</em> come up with the right business model.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[This started as a post about how Java EE 5 has improved my experience in writing webservices based applications.

However, for the past hour I've been sitting fighting with this crazy WYSIWYG editor (I've <a href="http://svetzal.wordpress.com/category/opinion/page/8/">blogged before</a> about how much I HATE browser-based editors) trying to get the simplest code snippet into my blog entry.

So I gave up writing that post and wrote this one instead. So there!

I'm not the first person to have this problem, so speak up! How the hell did you solve it?]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[OK, so around 2005 we did some projects with WebServices.

They were successful, but we wrote a lot more code than we wanted to. We hand-coded the WSDL to get the best interoperability between platforms (Java and .NET), and because if we'd used auto-generated WSDL it was an absolute disaster (no big shocker we had interop problems).

And the persistence layer was a nightmare. We were brokering data between persistent objects and WSDL-generated stubs, and the WSDL-generated stubs had no support for object-equality like we needed in the persistence tier, so this lead to a LOT of boiler-plate code.

Here's what I wrote this morning:

[sourcecode language="Java"]
@Stateless
@WebService
public class SimpleServiceBean
             implements SimpleServiceRemote {

    @WebMethod
    public String getMessage() {
        return "Hello, World!";
    }

}[/sourcecode]
Not a big shocker there, Java EE 5 makes things a lot easier, especially with all the XML removed. What did impress me however, was looking at the WSDL. It was clean. Pretty darn close to what I'd have coded by hand.Generating a client-side test through JAX-WS was equally fun (yeah, I'm a NetBeans fanboy these days so I just used the Wizard to generate the WS client stubs in my project):
[sourcecode language="Java"]
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args)
                       throws Exception {

        SimpleServiceBeanService service =
                new SimpleServiceBeanService();
        SimpleServiceBean ss =
                service.getSimpleServiceBeanPort();

        System.out.println(
                "Message: " + ss.getMessage());

    }
}[/sourcecode]
So that was cool, but how easy would it be to do some actual work? So I set up an Entity model bean called Recipient (which I won't post, but it was simple too), had an EntityManager injected into my service bean, made a function to save a Recipient (which in JPA can also create them). Notice how I return the recipient object returned by the .merge() operation so that it has it's identity field properly filled out...
[sourcecode language="Java"]
@Stateless
@WebService
public class SimpleServiceBean
             implements SimpleServiceRemote {

    @PersistenceContext
    EntityManager em;

    @WebMethod
    public String getMessage() {
        return "Hello, World!";
    }

    @WebMethod
    public Recipient saveRecipient(Recipient r) {
        return em.merge(r);
    }

}[/sourcecode]
And then modified the client... (notice how I don't set the identity of the Recipient, so that the server knows it needs to create rather than save this object)
[sourcecode language="Java"]
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args)
                       throws Exception {

        SimpleServiceBeanService service =
                new SimpleServiceBeanService();
        SimpleServiceBean ss =
                service.getSimpleServiceBeanPort();

        Recipient r = new Recipient();
        r.setEmail("steve@threewisemen.ca");
        r.setName("Steven Vetzal");

        r = ss.saveRecipient(r);

        System.out.println(
            r.getName()+" "+r.getEmail()+" "+r.getId());

    }
}[/sourcecode]
And that was it. Simple client - server data brokering and persistence using proper WebServices, with very very little boilerplate code.

Now the example is truly simplistic. For example, the generated Recipient class (that was joyously auto-generated from the auto-generated WSDL that was generated from my proper model class) does not have any object equality code in place (.equals() and .hashcode() methods) so that will cause me grief in Swing and JSF clients that need to render and work with a UI full of these entities. But it is squeaky clean without a single crazy additional method enforced by the infrastructure - it's just a POJO with some XML annotations to help JAXB along.

But I'm going to selfishly wallow in this simplicity for the next day or two anyways just for fun :)]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Database Queries - Programmatic Criteria vs. EQL?</title>
  <link>https://svetzal.wordpress.com/2007/11/16/database-queries-programmatic-criteria-vs-eql/</link>

  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[So, an associate of mine is really enjoying programmatic database query criteria, and now it's spilled over onto me :)

The use-case that wins us over is when your statements introduce conditional constraints. Think of the following in SQL:

[sourcecode language="sql"]
SELECT * FROM table;[/sourcecode]
Not a lot of reason there to stray. In fact, with Hibernate persistence under Java EE, this is often shortened to the following EQL (EJB Query Language):
[sourcecode language="sql"]
FROM Entity[/sourcecode]
There's really not much to optimize there. But consider when you want to query on a constraint that may or may not be present. Like this:
[sourcecode language="sql"]
SELECT * FROM table WHERE column=:value[/sourcecode]
But you may or may not have a value, so then you need 2 different queries; let's use PHP:
[sourcecode language="php"]
$query = "SELECT * FROM table";
if (defined($value)) {
    $query .= " WHERE column='";
    $query .= mysql_real_escape($value);
    $query .= "'";
}[/sourcecode]
(I've ranted before on dynamically generated SQL, but let that pass for now) So our code begins to get complicated. What if we have many WHERE clauses? Then you need to do all kinds of string manipulation to ensure that you have appropriate AND and OR keywords, proper groupings in parentheses, you get the idea. Kind of a mess.So, enter Programmatic Criteria. Here's some Java code using a Hibernate session:
[sourcecode language="Java"]
Criteria crit = session.createCriteria(Entity.class);
if (value != null) crit.add(
                Restrictions.eq("column", value));[/sourcecode]
Much much simpler eh? A little foreign if you're used to SQL, but straightforward to any object-oriented developer. Here's something a little more complex:
[sourcecode language="Java"]
Criteria crit = session.createCriteria(Entity.class);

Criteria group1 = Restrictions.conjunction(); // AND
if (value1 != null) group1.add(
                Restrictions.eq("column1", value1));
if (value2 != null) group1.add(
                Restrictions.ne("column2", value2));
if (value3 != null) group1.add(
                Restrictions.ge("column3", value3));

Criteria group2 = Restrictions.disjunction(); // OR
if (value4 != null) group2.add(
                Restrictions.eq("column4", value4));
if (value5 != null) group2.add(
                Restrictions.eq("column5", value5));

crit.add(Restrictions.conjunction()
         .add(group1)
         .add(group2));[/sourcecode]
So why is this useful? On a project we're on right now, we're concentrating business focused data-access logic into a single place to set up all of our criteria so that we can perform some automated testing. It's working out pretty nicely, and I have to admit - the code is darn clean compared to a boot-load of string manipulation.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Learn Your Tools, Learn Others Too</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I've always lived at the fringe of computing, with a foot in the popular and a foot in the obscure. When I was a kid, I had a Tandy TRS-80 when all my friends had the Vic-20 or Commodore 64 - and I attribute my open-mindedness to this early acceptance of the obscure.

In my career I spent a lot of time on alternative platforms, with my early start on the Commodore Amiga, exploring *BSD and Linux on PC compatible hardware, a brief specialty in Silicon Graphics workstations and servers, right up to these days on my Macbook Pro.

My programming career has been just as varied. As a hobbyist I enjoyed 6809 and 68K assembly programming, BASIC and C / C++ programming. Professionally enjoying Perl, C++, Ruby and Java programming. I continue to tinker on the fringe dabbling in Scala and even a little retro-focused on Smalltalk.

The recent Smalltalk focus was triggered by the rising popularity of solid-state-disk drives. I read a review today of the <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2007/11/08/samsungs-64gb-sata-ii-ssd-drive-hands-on/">64GB Samsung SSD</a>, as I've been wondering if we're going to see a flip that makes traditional storage obsolete. Imagine a world where all you have is RAM, it's your permanent storage, your transient storage. A world that will be well understood by the Smalltalk crowd.

One thing that I continue to shake my head at is people putting down other programming languages. I see it all the time, even among people that really ought to know better.

Over the holidays I'm having fun continuing to explore. I've begun a re-write of my company's core CMS product using some modern Java techniques - had the core interface together in under a day of development. This is mostly thanks to Java EE 5 and the JBoss Seam framework. This is just as fast as anything I've ever put together in Ruby or Perl, which proves yet again that it has little to do with your programming language, and everything to do with your tools and techniques (which come from experience!).

The lesson learned from this is simple - learn your tools and open your eyes. Don't draw technology conclusions until you've explored the current state-of-the-art in each realm. Many people have jumped away from Java because they were frustrated by their old techniques, old tools, or old frameworks. I believe they'll be back, perhaps not for the Java programming language, but likely for the unfortunately named Java Virtual Machine (which runs code produced by <a href="http://www.robert-tolksdorf.de/vmlanguages.html">hundreds of different compilers and environments</a>). This is why I enjoy <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/">Scala</a> and <a href="http://jruby.codehaus.org/">JRuby</a>.

But also branch beyond your environment. Spend some time playing with Python, OCaml, Javascript, Haskell. You're going to learn something - it's inevitable. Ignore the language snobs who say you will never understand their language because of where you came from. Go with an open mind and learn what you can. Go beyond the syntax of the language and look at how they assemble projects, how they modularize code.

Now <a href="http://lukeplant.me.uk/blog.php?id=1107301645">some people disagree with this idea</a>, citing reasons such as demotivation (you get demoralized about your "home" environment, wishing it "measured up"). It hasn't worked this way for me, perhaps it does for others, but I have to believe that if you are aware of this risk you can act on that knowledge.

Happy developing :)]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Software Development Estimates</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I've blogged before on the fallacies of software development estimates. I found <a href="http://a.khavr.com/2007/12/24/why-i-dont-give-fixed-price-software-developer-story/">this posting</a> particularly well thought-out and illustrative of the problem at hand.

While I still engage in the "crap shoot" on smaller projects, I'm long done providing any kind of fixed-price bid on any project of significant size. I continue to estimate, but I've found the iterative approach so effective that I can't imagine approaching things any other way.

I still have some customers that rely on me providing estimates, in which case I adhere to the "target budget" approach for development where specific features are taken into consideration but not promised. It requires a fair bit of explaining, which lengthens our proposals but so far this has worked well for me.

One thing I need to work on, based on feedback from a customer a few weeks back, was that my approach is very technical in nature. I need to get better at tying technical objectives to business objectives, providing better business focused milestones. Always something to be improved :)]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Keeping A Lid On It</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[So I went to the TSOT Rails Project night last night, it was good to see some familiar faces and I enjoyed the presentations.

There was some to-be-expected discussion about Zed's famous rant, which I won't link to because it's a little profane, and 3 presentations on projects that various members of the Toronto Rails community are working on.

Most technology focused communities have many participants that joined the community out of personal frustration with competing technologies. This is completely fair, and a great way to grow new communities. And I should just expect a degree of bashing when I go.

I'm a pretty opinionated guy. I've formed opinions about many things over the years, but the strongest opinion I seem to have gained is that opinions should not be taken as fact.  Which in itself is a bit of a paradox :)

I found myself in one conversation, where I lashed out at some anti-technology (Java specifically) comments, surprised myself before I could reel myself back in. Then spent the rest of the night thinking about it.

Now I've been known to bash technologies, I've never held back personal frustration at PHP or ASP. Why would I get so frustrated at others doing the same?

I think this is a common thing. We all travel through life with our own pools of experience, some overlap others, and especially with technology they are very complicated and funny shaped with weird overlappings. For example, take Java - frustration as a Java developer could be spawned from having to work with so many different environments. I really can't fault a developer from reaching this personal state after years with Struts 1, or WebSphere, or J2EE.

I suppose the thing that frustrates me most is the blinders that some people put on. They form an opinion, and then never look at the technology again. It's as if they expect that the technology will always be as it once was, or that the overall technology sphere is a reflection of just the particular facet that they saw.

Despite past frustrations with PHP, I've enjoyed tinkering with things like CakePHP. I'm willing to explore PHP5. Despite past frustration with J2EE and JSP/Struts, I've moved on to adopt and enjoy Java EE 5 and Facelets/Seam. Despite frustration with Ruby On Rails, I've enjoyed adopting Ruby as a replacement for administrative Perl scripting. I haven't let petty technical faults that burned me in the past ruin my whole experience with the technology and keep me from building interesting things with it today.

I need to get better at recognizing personal opinion based on frustration and genuine zealotry. I feel pretty good about arguing with zealots (they deserve it), but not with folks who just had unfortunate experiences.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Living with Maven2</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I often see a lot of complaining about the <a href="http://maven.apache.org/">Apache Maven</a> build tool. In fact, sometimes I do a lot of complaining about it myself.

The fact is, however, that ever since my friend <a href="http://www.sphericalimprovement.com/blogs/mbowler/">Mike Bowler</a> introduced me to it I've been hooked.

<b>The Good</b>

Maven provides a well defined <a href="http://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-lifecycle.html">build lifecycle</a> with logical stages that fire in a known sequence. You can noodle with it a little by triggering plugins at different points in the execution, but there's only a couple places to look to see where that's done (actually only 1 place - your POM - if you're not using build profiles).

I can't say how many times I've tried to untie the tangled shoelace of an Ant build. What goals trigger what goals? What is the thread of assembly? With Maven, no matter how large the project, you know the story, and with Ant you're never sure - and the larger the project the less sure you are.

Now in Ant's defense, it is not designed to help you with this complexity. It is solely up to the strength of the developers maintaining your build. Making an Ant build easy to understand just takes good structure and comments. Good luck, you're on your own.

You could say (and I have before) that Maven reduces things to a common denominator. You can't get "fancy" with super-tricky sophisticated builds that only you can parse. Your Maven builds do feel a little "dumbed down". And in my world, this is worth its weight in gold. I can't afford to have a high hit-by-a-bus factor on any of our projects - or a rogue super-smart developer injecting little bits of brittle magic into the most critical piece of source-code in the entire project (you do consider your build file the most important piece of code, right?).

<b>The Bad</b>

Sometimes it's really compelling to add in that experimental Codehaus repository to get that nifty new plugin. Don't do it.

Adding plugin repositories is the quickest way you have to destabilize your build.

While the core Maven repositories are fairly stable (I don't know anyone personally ganked by core plugin updates), the maven experimental and third-party repositories must be very carefully considered.

One of the first things you will want when using Maven is a <b>LOCAL</b> repository for artifacts and plugins. Move any required plugins into your local repository after careful consideration, ensure your local repository is the only external one referenced in your POM, and you simply can't get bitten by any external factors.

Setting up a local repository is trivial. You can do it under any website, on any of your internal web servers or on your shared hosting account. It requires no software. All it is is a file / directory structure - and it is easy to prime by simply copying your own ~/.m2/repository folder onto it and then telling Maven how to get to it in your POM.

I chuckle at people's comments about Maven "downloading the Internet" to populate a developer's local workstation repository. Some of the Maven mirrors haven't been the fastest (and I've been frustrated in the past by hanging downloads), but your local repository fixes all this. If your system is spending more than a few minutes downloading artifacts then you seriously need to look at your third-party dependencies and see what you might want to trim out. If you haven't been careful with your transitive dependencies, you may find you're downloading 4 different versions of Xerces or some such silliness.

In fact, I find it's good practice to <b>occasionally erase</b> your local workstation repository and do a full build from scratch. This will tell you if you've accidentally crept in any additional artifacts you haven't mirrored onto your local repository. It'll also purge any experimental plugins you might have played with in the past.

<b>The Ugly</b>

Yeah, documentation has never been Maven's strong point. Get the <a href="http://www.devzuz.com/web/guest/products/resources#BBWM">Better Builds with Maven</a> book (it's free). Seriously, get it and give it a quick read. Then go back to the Maven website and things will make more sense for you.

<b>The Tips and Tricks</b>

These are some tips I can provide when working with Maven:
<ul>
	<li>Netbeans with the maven2 plugin understands Maven2 projects as first-class projects. Your parent POM projects open as a POM project and allow you to easily open modules (sub-projects), which is a nice approach to resolving the hierarchial project problem.
<ul>
	<li>Changes to your POM are also reflected IMMEDIATELY within Netbeans, no more shelling out to re-generate out-of-sync IDE project files</li>
	<li>And fer cryin out loud, DON'T check in Eclipse or Netbeans project files into your source-code repository for a Maven project</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Accept and use the default directory structure for your source code</li>
	<li>Use a local repository for artifacts and plugins</li>
	<li>Don't put version numbers for dependencies in your module POMs, collect these into your parent POM in a &lt;dependencyManagement/&gt; block</li>
	<li>Use the Netbeans graph plugin or <a href="http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-dependency-plugin/examples/resolving-conflicts-using-the-dependency-tree.html">Maven dependency tree</a> plugin to find out what your unexpected transitive dependencies are (if you haven't looked, you've probably got'em)</li>
	<li>Use &lt;exclusions/&gt; within your &lt;dependency/&gt; blocks to keep unwanted transitive dependencies from sneaking in</li>
	<li>Make sure you understand what dependencies you're using that are provided at run-time (say inside your server container), and mark them as such - huge candidates are things like servlet-apis, j2ee-apis, etc.</li>
</ul>
These simple tips will help keep your Maven builds lean and clean and dependable, and let you drop in any developer familiar with Maven to have them immediately productive.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Performance Profiling with JBoss Seam - Part 1</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[So, I decided I had had enough of looking at 400-600ms server prep times for Seam pages on a project we're working on. It just didn't seam right - could the Seam framework really have this much of an impact on performance?

I did some digging, and I came up with some interesting baseline stats. These were done by actually just adding a new webpage to an existing app (kind of, let's see how fast we can make this app go approach).

I tried initial testing between a simple page and a page that used a &lt;ui:composition&gt; and found no difference in performance, so all the tests below use a simple XHTML page that is a composition with a backing template and a single region insertion. The page uses a single &lt;h:outputText&gt; component that displays a value from a message bundle for the HTML title.

I tested out the following scenarios, here there are with my results:

1. Basic Page
<ul>
	<li>32.898ms mean request time across 1000 requests with 4-threads</li>
	<li>~30.4 tps</li>
</ul>
2. Basic Page with 12 &lt;h:outputText&gt; components on it that call a simple method on a stateless POJO Seam component
<ul>
	<li>33.048ms mean request time across 1000 requests with 4 threads</li>
	<li>~30.3 tps</li>
</ul>
3. Basic Page with 12 &lt;h:outputText&gt; components on it that call a simple method on a stateful (Conversation scope) POJO Seam component
<ul>
	<li>44.142ms mean request time across 1000 requests with 4 threads</li>
	<li>~22.7 tps</li>
</ul>
4. Basic Page with 12 &lt;h:outputText&gt; components on it that call a simple method on a Stateful EJB (Conversation scope) component
<ul>
	<li>51.981ms mean request time across 1000 requests with 4 threads</li>
	<li>~19.2 tps</li>
</ul>
5. Same as # 4, but I added injection of the Seam logging handle, the Seam Identity component and a Seam managed Hibernate Session handle
<ul>
	<li>78.249ms mean request time across 1000 requests with 4 threads</li>
	<li>~12.8tps</li>
</ul>
As you can see, the base processing time introduced by the Seam framework is negligible. On very high capacity sites that do not require EJBs you might consider using POJO components that will gain you about 10% performance over the EJB infrastructure.

As you can see by test #5 above, when you start injecting components beware of overhead. My testing was very simplistic, just using Apache "ab", which means every single request included the overhead of creating the session and conversation scopes - and in the case of # 5, also includes setup of the Log, Identity, and Hibernate Session handles.

As a result, test # 5 above is a little unfair, because most requests are going to be repeat requests from the same visitors, which will not include this overhead.

I'm fairly pleased with Seam, and this testing allays my fears about it sucking too much performance from an application from a framework perspective. Now to quantify some of the effects of the techniques we're using on these other projects.

It's not at all surprising to note that your approach to a Seam web application design can have considerable impact on the performance of your application. Techniques that work well in other environments (ie. PHP, Rails, and other highly horizontally scalable "shared-nothing" environments) do not work well in Seam.

This should not be surprising, as the whole value of Seam is in the contextual component model, where you have shared resources that allow you to do things like save yourself round trips to the database and should theoretically allow you to scale a single instance of an application higher than "shared-nothing" environments.

Stay tuned for part 2, where I will examine in more detail ajax interaction timing and general Seam application design.]]></content:encoded>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hi, 

We had the same experience with the cost of injections in seam 
and actually had to change parts of our application into using a 
view specific DTO-pattern instead. Sad but true. See this post for 
details.  http://seamframework.org/Community/SeamPerformanceProblemRewardingWorkaround

What we also found out (much to my astonishment) that it isn't always a 1-to-1 
mapping between the number of bean references on your page and the actual
number of invocations on the beans. This becomes very apparent when you 
have complex page layouts with lots of fragment-compositions. For instance 
I could remove one #{pojo.ref} on the page and reduce the number of times it 
was called by 15-20. How about that.  : /]]></wp:comment_content>

  <title>Performance Profiling with JBoss Seam - Part 2</title>

  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[On my last post, I began dissecting what might be causing <a href="http://labs.jboss.com/jbossseam/">JBoss Seam</a> to be "slow" on one of our projects. In this post, I'm going to show the results of some testing on another Seam based project which hasn't shown slow performance.

At TWM we have a product called <a href="http://threewisemen.ca/article.php?id=AK6-3C">Communicator</a> that does bulk correspondence for print or email. It archives this correspondence over a WebService interface to a central server, which has a Seam based UI to browse and examine the correspondence sent.

This application does not have any Ajax style interaction, and does not use anything outside the core JSF tag library (&lt;h:*/&gt; and &lt;f:*/&gt; tags). It does not use RichFaces like the previous project I examined.

This application is not conversational, as the end-user interactions are very simplistic. As a result, the work is done by a couple of Session scoped POJO service beans. Persistence is provided by JPA using Hibernate, and the application deploys inside JBoss 4.2.2.GA. I also have EHCache configured as a 2nd level cache provider for Hibernate.

There are 3 main pages in the application:

1. main

This holds a search dialog and search results.

2. recipient

This holds a list of correspondence sent to a selected recipient.

3. communication

This displays an individual piece of correspondence sent (HTML shown inline, other datatypes downloadable).

After figuring out the magic to allow <a href="http://selenium.openqa.org/">Selenium</a> to run integration tests on the site, I decided to use my main integration test case to stress the application so I could gather timing information. (By the way, the "magic" was just assigning some ID elements to forms and form elements, not all that magical as it turns out! Selenium IDE needs some stable identifiers in the HTML to grab ahold of when recording tests.)

So the average response times of each page? (averaged over 25 requests, as reported by my servlet filter)

main - 62ms, or avg 16 tps
recipient - 66ms, or avg 15 tps
communication -  67ms, or avg 15 tps

As you can see, on this simple application I am seeing respectable response times. You can't compare these times to my Part 1 post, as you're not comparing apples to apples - I simply can't use Apache ab to benchmark this, and as such this does not reflect any improvements through concurrency or any degradations due to HTTP overhead.

I've decided to use this application for further testing (because it's a TWM application, I'm free to experiment with it).

Further posts of mine will concentrate on using a similar testing style in order to gather results so that I can make some direct comparisons. Specifically using Selenium to drive representative interactions through the web UI, and using results from the servlet filter to determine response times.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Wow, so here's a short one for you.

I'm tuning an application to utilize the Hibernate 2nd level cache. The application uses Hibernate Annotations extensively to mark up the model and map it to PostgreSQL.

And I've just caught myself sitting back and wishing for old-school Hibernate XML mapping files so I wouldn't have to recompile the project to explore each scenario.

I'm not changing a bit of application logic, this is purely an installation environment specific tuning exercise. And yet I have to recompile code and copy it up to the server instead of just tuning an XML file or two and restarting.

I know a lot of people (including myself!) have become enamored with Annotations, but you really have to sit back and understand what problems are best solved with them, and maybe what problems aren't.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I think blogging from a portable device will have to fall under the category of microblogging,..

Suffice to say this is my first iPhone blog post, and I'm sure it won't be my last.

The general experience is a little cramped, but I think a lot of people whine about the iPhone/iPod Touch keyboards too much - I find it comfortable to type on and can even get a little speed going.

The Wordpress interface is way too simplistic though. The UI is very basic, so for my next post I will be using the full site. Here I am left with the fear that features I depend on like automatic draft saving are absent (ie no reassuring "last saved at" message).

I hope as time goes on people don't continue to think of iPhone visitors the same as other mobile phone visitors - the platform is so rich to strip things down to the lowest common denominator leaves you disappointed and wanting.

** Update **

I couldn't finish this post on the iPhone :( you can't edit posts on the iPhone interface and as it turns out you can't access the normal editor on the mobile Safari (you don't get a cursor to type or edit).

Looks like I won't be doing much blogging from the iPhone after all in the near future.

Or maybe it's time to go looking for another blog site?]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I leased a nice Dell server this year to help stabilize our IT infrastructure at Three Wise Men. With it I purchased "next business day onsite service".

On Monday this week I arrived at work to find two hard drives dead which broke our RAID storage. So I arranged a service call to replace the drives yesterday and promised my customer we would resume testing today.

So, needless to say Dell made me a liar. They never came yesterday which has now put me three days behind. 

What's the point of paying for service if Dell can't deliver on it?]]></content:encoded>

  <title>VMware ESXi At Long Last</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Today we finally got our Dell VM server going again. We had lost 2 disks from our 4 disk RAID5 so we needed to reinstall. 

So I decided to give VMware ESXi 3.5 a try. In fact I even found a how-to on installing it to a bootable USB stick. 

So now our RAID volume is totally dedicated to VM storage and we spent the rest of the day getting our recovered VM images onto the box. 

I am reasonably impressed with the VMware tools like the migration tool. Once we had things figured out it only took about 20 minutes per 20GB VM image to get them transferred over. 

Figuring out the right procedure was a bit of an adventure though. You can't just copy the VM folder to the ESX storage as the virtual hardware is unrecognizeable. And if you have disk image files bigger than 2GB you might be in for a 'treat'. 

It looks like I will be able to get by with under $1000 in license fees too. 

The key reasons I am wiling to spend money on ESX instead of continuing to use the free VMware Server product??

- proper disk snapshots, no crazy single snapshot limitation
- no operating system to maintain
- I can hard bind resources like CPUs to a VM
- and lastly I can set up a quad processor vm system for vertical scalability testing]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Integrity, Transparency and Trust</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[At Three Wise Men we've just finished off a reasonably large project, and a few things really struck me in the end about the way we operated and how it turned out.

I've always been one for integrity. Do what you say you're going to do, when you say you're going to do it. It's OK to say you're not sure what you're going to build, or you're not sure when it will be built, just be sure that you have a little transparency in your processes and you involve the customer so that you maintain their trust that you are building something appropriate not wasting their time and money.

Customers get nervous fast when they feel you are wasting their time and/or money. And it's exactly that - a feeling - which just might be borne of a lack of communications or honesty, and it is completely orthogonal to your skill and intent to deliver their project.

So my policy is thus - communicate, be honest and do honest work, have a transparent process so that your customer can see what's going on, and they will trust you.

In reality, I often wish things were so simple. As entrepreneurs, in our struggle to build our businesses, we sometimes take on work for various higher purposes - which might be to forge new relationships, maintain infrastructure and overhead in times of slumpy sales, or explore new technology paths and vendor partnerships.

And sometimes that work imposes on this one policy that I particularly favour - transparency.

In this situation, I maintain transparency as far as I can. Sometimes it's not very far.

My hope is that businesses I work with will see the effectiveness of transparency in building trust. Each project we take on in which we have full transparency teaches me a little more about how I can explain its effectiveness to those who haven't discovered its benefits.

Transparency has brought my business our most successful projects to date, and incidentally, those were also the most profitable projects.

What is Transparency in my business?
<ul>
	<li>Who are the people involved</li>
	<li>What did they work on yesterday, what are they working on today</li>
	<li>What, if any, issues are keeping from getting their work done</li>
	<li>What is the current status of the project, and when will the next deliverable be ready</li>
	<li>What are the costs incurred, to-date and predicted</li>
</ul>
Some of these items change with the project (the people), some of then are static in our process model (deliverable dates are on an iterative schedule and fixed, costs are known and predictable). And the remainder are made transparent by our process model by exposing techniques such as "listen-in" on our daily status meetings, and extensive customer involvement in planning and prioritization.

So what does transparency mean in your business? Where do you struggle with customer trust and how might you apply it to help in your own projects?]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Taking a stand, saying "NO" to software development quotes</title>
  <link>https://svetzal.wordpress.com/2008/08/30/taking-a-stand-saying-no-to-software-development-quotes/</link>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>

Starting Tuesday, I will no longer issue quotes for software development.

I've been doing a lot of thinking about our Software Development business. Over the past 6 years we've done over 75 projects. We have loosely followed an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development">Agile</a> approach to software development, but have always been pressured to provide fixed quotes. It has been difficult to reconcile the desire to be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development">Agile</a> versus the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model">Waterfall</a> approach and up-front engineering required to provide a fixed quote.

Software projects are messy for the simple reason that people are not computers. We do not have perfect memory, we do not have perfect communications, we are strongly affected by emotion. Despite all of our efforts to communicate a project vision or structure, something is always left out. Something is always misinterpreted. You simply cannot avoid it.

We had another example just this past week, where we were given data to produce reports but there was no way to extrapolate the reports from the data provided. The customer simply had no idea how messy and inconsistent their data was - and didn't believe it until we showed them. Thankfully, they had budget to expand the scope instead of aborting the project.

So, starting Tuesday, no more quotes - we will be strictly billing by iteration - 3 to 10 day sprints of development for 1 to 3 developers. This simplifies our pricing and quoting immensely - and we may also follow some of <a href="http://obiefernandez.com/">Obie Fernandez</a>'s advice from <a href="http://en.oreilly.com/rails2008/public/content/home">RailsConf</a> and turn out some pre-priced products that fit our most common project patterns (of the 75 projects we've done under this company to date, there are seriously only a handful of patterns).

This will also allow me to try a new approach in taking the next step with the company, and that is to try my hand again at systemizing the sales process. Fixed price quotes always put pressure to bring technical resources into a sale early, almost always turning it into a technical sale. My hope is that reducing the need for technical input early in the sales process will increase the effectiveness of sales staff in closing projects. They'll be more confident because they won't need to get in beyond their depth in technical details.

This is primarily to address the problem I currently have in my company which is an amazing ability to accomplish but a lack of actual assignments worth accomplishing.

Oh, and in case you haven't figured it out - I'm hiring :) I have a sales position open right now that I need to fill - if you're interested in the great lifestyle choice of living and working in a rewarding sales position in <a href="http://region.durham.on.ca/">Durham Region</a> (just east of Toronto) give me a <a href="http://threewisemen.ca/index.php?id=9R2-1AT">call</a>. You'll be connecting customers with the finest team of developers assembled in the GTA.</div>]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Off To Find My Shoes</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[So, I recently blogged about my new "No Quotes" policy at Three Wise Men, and I've blogged in the past about the perils of software development quotes.

Lately I've been explaining this to some of my business associates in other industries and I'm getting a lot of blank stares. In fact, the two times I've explained it at greater length, each time I've been asked "Do other businesses in your industry do this?"

I think the geek in me is showing again here. I'm excited that I think I can finally pull this off - but I think others don't see the problem as I see it (or even at all).

It will be quite a challenge to explain this to people who don't see the problem, who don't believe there is one, or who have only benefited in the past from it. And this is a very long list of people.

So, with the initial flurry of preaching to the choir over, I am setting out to nail down the real issue - which I believe is risk management. Looking at competition in my industry, this looks to be a common approach.

But do I really care about whether other businesses in my industry work this way? Do I really care to take the same approach is my competitors? Doesn't this just water down my business to look like all the others? What do I do when my USP (Unique Selling Proposition) vanishes in a puff of smoke?

Were these reactions to my ramblings a function of my inability to explain myself in clear business terms, the knee jerk reaction to "Steve's going off again... another weird geeky topic nobody cares about..."?

An associate of mine had a great way of explaining what I believe to be my biggest shortcoming when it comes to marketing and sales, he called it "selling the pygmies". It's a long-winded story about a tribe of pygmies that make shoes, and trying to sell the pygmies instead of the shoes.

So, I'm off to find my shoes :) to describe their comfortable sole and double-wide shine, in hopes that I can help people understand.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>[DRAFT] Using Squid + Apache for Maximum Web App Performance</title>
  <link>https://svetzal.wordpress.com/?p=58</link>
  <pubDate>Tue, 17 Mar 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
  <dc:creator>svetzal</dc:creator>
  <guid isPermaLink="false">http://svetzal.wordpress.com/?p=58</guid>
  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[In this guide, I'm going to go through how I've configured high-performance web applications in the past using Squid and Apache to front-end the application server(s).

I was not completely alone in this, and need to thank a peer of mine, Tyler Hutcheon, for doing the initial research on Squid.

I've personally found this environment highly stable - I have one server environment that processes about 25M requests per month that gets recycled (stopped &amp; started again) maybe 3-4 times a year for administrative purposes.

I've used this technique in front of Rails and Java applications of various types. I find it's quite useful for taking a great deal of load off of the application server itself - given that many web app pages consist these days of many portions of javascript, css and images. And many frameworks (like JBoss Seam on the Java side for example) really don't provide any ability to consolidate javascript or css into single files so you end up with quite a few requests back to the server for these individual fragment files.

Earlier this year, I had an application that had a very complex table-based page with a tremendous amount of data on it. Using these techniques I accelerated this complex page from 30-40 seconds to render down to 5-8 seconds - strictly by injecting appropriate cache-control headers and keeping these requests from distracting the application server. I continued to use only a single application server instance.

I also need to credit YSlow here - without this tool, I was completely lost with regards to where our performance was going. We were blaming all kinds of crazy things looking for the cause of this slow page-load time. And it simply turned out to be the latency in assembling 1/2 dozen or so javascripts, a dozen or so CSS fragments, and a couple hundred images.

A word of caution however - this is not a magic bullet. The first time you go through this exercise you will discover all kinds of things you will want to change in your application in order to help it optimize this environment. And you won't be able to fully take advantage of this environment until you do. However once tuned, you can realize some fairly dramatic gains, and if you re-use these techniques on your future applications you can achieve these gains with no additional programming overhead.

Also, whenever you deal with fixed time caching you have the trade-off of quick performance versus stale data. An important attribute to consider is what I call the immediacy of your data. Take for example product image thumbnails on an e-commerce site, if they are changed how quickly does that change need to be reflected on the public site? 3-seconds? 3-minutes? 3-hours? 3-days?

A cache time as low as 1 second can improve performance by a factor of 10 when that asset is being requested 10 times per second.

So lets get started...

1. Your Application

Set up and start your application, make sure it's working correctly.

On my production servers, I like to run the application on a private network interface or on an IP alias assigned to your loopback device. In your production environment, there should be no reason to expose your application directly to the Internet.

For a Rails process-based environment where you may want to start several Mongrel instances, sometimes I bind to the same IP address on multiple ports, and sometimes I set up multiple IP addresses - the choice is yours. Usually I end up re-using the same private IP address and assigning each Mongrel instance its own port. For the best performance, I typically start 2-4 Mongrel processes per CPU core in the server - but this depends on how your application is structured. If you have a lot of latency between your app server(s) and your database server(s) you may want to increase that number.

For a Java thread-based environment, you only need to start multiple server instances if you are looking for fault tolerance - there is no need to do this for performance. If your application server's front-end is Tomcat based, you will probably want to tune the number of threads down from the default (250!) to 2-4 times the number of CPU cores in your server, again depending on the latencies inherent in your application. In my opinion, 250 is a terrible default - I've seen so many apps crash and burn because of this when overloaded.

If you have several physical or virtual servers assigned to host your application server instances, you'll want to make sure they're connected by a private switched network that is segmented from your production traffic. I've done this as simply as using a cross-over cable for a pair of hosts, or with a segmented VLAN on a managed switch, or on a VMWare ESX server using a separate private virtual switch dedicated to the application server farm.

2. Apache (v2.2) Load Balancer

Apache HTTP's mod_proxy module has a capable balancer. The purpose of your Apache installation will be to handle incoming requests on a single private IP address and port, and proxy them back using a load-balancing strategy to all of your running application server instances.

If you are only using a single Java application server instance, there is actually no need for this step. However, if you want to remain open to being able to expand your capacity quickly you might set this up anyways so that it's ready to extend on a moments notice.

The first step in setting up Apache is to set up your balancer configuration. I have a block like this:
<pre>&lt;Proxy balancer://publishing&gt;
   BalancerMember ajp://192.168.254.1:8009 route=cms1 loadfactor=1
   BalancerMember ajp://192.168.254.2:8009 route=cms2 loadfactor=1
&lt;/Proxy&gt;</pre>
We're defining this balancer with the name "publishing". Note also that I'm defining the members to use AJP (Apache JServ Protocol) to proxy back. You can use AJP or HTTP here.

The "route" directive specifics a logical name for each member, and the "loadfactor" provides the ability for you to weigh down more powerful servers with a heavier load than your less powerful ones. I'm using the same "loadfactor" for each which means both members will get the same number of requests.

Now you set up the virtual paths on your Apache server to pass requests back to your defined balancer(s).
<pre>&lt;Location /cms/content&gt;
    ProxyPass balancer://publishing/cms/content
&lt;/Location&gt;</pre>
The virtual path "/cms/content" from your apache server will now be proxied back to the "/cms/content" path on your balancer called "publishing".

The content at this path for our CMS system is provided in a purely stateless manner. There is no session to worry about, so we can have any server in the farm deliver it.

If you're passing back to an application where you need to maintain session "stickiness" with a particular server (this means that when a visitor comes to your site, they're serviced by the same server in your farm for the duration of their session - this is important because the other servers normally don't know about their session unless you're using some kind of shared session mechanism like storing it in a database or in a memcache instance or using a Java application server with clustering enabled).

Here's how to maintain stickiness:
<pre>&lt;Location /cms&gt;
    ProxyPass balancer://admin/cms stickysession=JSESSIONID
&lt;/Location&gt;</pre>
Note the "stickysession" directive. This points to the cookie name used to track the session. In this case, the standard variable for Java web applications, "JSESSIONID".

Something you may want to do is open up the balancer-manager on your install so that you can get a little visibility into how the server's doing. Add this block to set that up:
<pre>&lt;Location /balancer-manager&gt;
    SetHandler balancer-manager
    AuthType Basic
    AuthName "Cluster Manager"
    AuthUserFile /home/cmslb/apache/conf/users.htpasswd
    Require valid-user
&lt;/Location&gt;</pre>
Don't forget to create your .htpasswd file with your username and password using the "htpasswd -c my.htpasswd myusername" command and ensure your "AuthUserFile" directive above matches where that file is on your server.

The astute observers will notice that I've sandboxed Apache in its own user account. This is just good security practice. You can sandbox each service individually, or if you're setting these things up in a multi-tenancy environment you might want to group all of the services under a particular tenant's user account.

In terms of tuning, there really isn't much to tune here other than the balancer weighting for each node. Tuning most happens in your application and Squid.

3. Squid Accelerator

You may be familiar with Squid as a caching proxy server for outgoing requests across a congested Internet connection, but you may not be familiar with it as an application accelerator for incoming requests.

The purpose of your Squid installation will be to handle public requests for URLs, and decide whether to immediately send back a cached version of the response or proxy the request back to your Apache installation, which will in turn balance it across your application server farm.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Today.

Today we are better than yesterday, but not as good as we will be tomorrow.

Today our tools are better than they were yesterday, but not as good as they will be tomorrow.

We build software today.

This is an important thing to remember as a software developer. When we look at the code we wrote yesterday, when we look forward to the code we will write tomorrow.

Every day we choose how we will be better tomorrow, with better knowledge or better tools.

The map to tomorrow is littered with roads, directions, and markers that point the way to new places. These new places each call to us in hopes that we will choose it over its competitors.

As a software developer, we struggle to find tomorrows improvement in this cacophony.

But today, we write code as best we can, today.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Software For Business Is Not Just A Tagline</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I've been doing a lot of work on my company, <a href="http://threewisemen.ca">Three Wise Men Inc.</a>, lately. Honing down on what makes the business special, getting right down into why I started the business and dissecting various frustrations I felt then, and have felt throughout the past 6 years of doing business.

In this market-driven society software is typically written for one of two reasons.

Profit. It may be to enable new business processes, or increase efficiency. It may be a commercial venture to entertain the masses.

Pleasure. It's fairly well known that regardless of developer skill, the artistic efforts of creating software are not much different a compulsion than painting, sculpting, dance, any classic art form.

In my business, I need to focus on the former while recognizing the latter - for without profit, I can't create this environment that encourages the latter.

So I am focusing around this idea that's quite over-stated but I believe poorly understood in this industry - that the commercial venture of creating software must be squarely focused on business value. Without this focus, the venture is a gamble. You might intuitively stumble into the right place, but unless your processes continually re-target you on your business goal your risk is high in not getting to where you need to be.

My challenge is finding a way to communicate this simply, that doesn't get lost in the market full of other companies promising the same thing but who don't have the processes to support that vision.

There are lots of fun ideas I could explore, like business goal seeking processes related to heat seeking missiles - except I don't really want to blow anyone up :)

I think I'm getting closer to <a href="http://svetzal.wordpress.com/2008/09/06/off-to-find-my-shoes/">finding my shoes</a>. While this relates to the risk of doing software development, it isn't a mitigating response - it's a total avoidance.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>SSL-Explorer killed by Barracuda ?! Forked as Adito ?!</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I say again, ?!

I have used SSL Explorer for years, it's an incredible piece of software that gives you a simple web console to initiate connectivity through ad-hoc SSL VPN connections into a private network. The VPN connections are established through a nifty little Java Applet that manages them. To say it's a VPN is a little bit of a misnomer too, it's not intended to simply give full network access to people - you have great fine-grained control over who can do what on your private network.

At my company, I have a link for our part-time bookkeeper so she can access the accounting system (that's all she needs). We use the included VNC java applet to provide multiple-viewer "conferences" for customer project show-offs, of course with a customer specific link to their machine(s) in our test lab. We've even set it up at customer sites to facilitate remote administration and maintenance of applications we've built for them.

It appears that the software was taken over by Barracuda, and they've decided to no longer offer this as a software product - only as an <a href="http://www.barracudanetworks.com/ns/products/sslvpn_overview.php">integrated hardware unit</a>. Looks interesting, but not at all what I'm looking for, and if the Adita project is any indication I'm not alone.

The <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/adito/">Adito project on SourceForge</a> was created May 17, 2008 by mattock, who immediately saw the need to keep this software open and available to people.

We were just discussing at the office expanding into a new vertical market, and incidentally are having a brainstorming session this afternoon. You can bet this is going to hit the board.

If you're using SSL-Explorer, make sure you take a look at Adito.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[You know, as much as Agile gets a bad rap for companies that poorly or inconsistently implement it, I absolutely hate to see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model">Waterfall</a> done badly. It's like they see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development">Agile</a> done badly, point their fingers and go running back into their hole to practice Waterfall again, except that they're doing Waterfall badly too.

And they wonder why their IT projects are costly and always slipping.

Oh, and for the record, Agile isn't Waterfall with sloppy schedules that everyone has to adapt to. Ugh.

Do others see this anti-pattern? Sloppy Waterfall being labelled Agile?]]></content:encoded>

  <title>My Ongoing Battle with Pseudomyxoma Peritonei (PMP)</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Introduction</strong>

So, I haven't told a lot of people about this. Truly, it has taken me a year to learn what I know now, and my journey isn't finished yet.

I am writing this now to tell my story, in hopes that it will help others in similar circumstances to me - either medically or professionally - should something like this happen to them.

Bear in mind that these are simply my own personal experiences. If you're going through something like this, your experiences WILL be different. Trust your doctors and your nurses and take this all with a grain of salt.

I live in Oshawa, Ontario, Canada. I am 40, a parent of 3 wonderful girls (ages 12, 14 and 18), happily married almost 17 years, and an entrepreneur. Needless to say, until all this began I already thought my life was challenging.

<strong>The Start</strong>

In January 2008, an emergency appendectomy alerted my family and I that I had (as I later learned) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudomyxoma_peritonei">Pseudomyxoma Peritonei</a> or <a href="http://www.pmppals.org/pseudomyxoma_peritonei.htm">PMP</a>. PMP is a rare cancer (literally one in a million) that for me started as a tumour in my appendix (an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenocarcinoma">adenocarcinoma</a>), which grew and ruptured it, spilling mucous and mucous producing cells into my abdomen. I had no idea that week in the hospital that I was beginning a journey that would last at least the next year and a half.

The surgeon at Oshawa General Hospital who did the appendectomy was unfamiliar with the condition, and his uncertainty alarmed us a little. He did however find and refer us to a specialist (Hepatobiliary, Pancreatic and Gastrointestinal Surgical Oncology) at <a href="http://www.sunnybrook.ca/">Sunnybrook</a> in Toronto. The specialist was wonderful to talk to - a doctor who not only knew of my condition, but was tracking and treating other patients with similar circumstances. This was a great relief after talking to the doctor in Oshawa who really didn't know what to tell us.

The specialist advised us that we needed to act within a couple years, but that we should take 6 months or so and determine more precisely what was going on in my abdomen. He advised us in April that there were a couple possible courses of action (wait and see vs. aggressive surgery), and then in September that he felt that I was a good candidate for the "<a href="http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/14651858.CD005659">Sugarbaker Procedure</a>" (an aggressive and complex surgical procedure, with several stages, and many possible outcomes). The basis of this was that I was young, in excellent health otherwise, and I wanted to aggressively pursue the cancer so that there was as little chance of recurrence as possible.

I mentioned I am an entrepreneur. In January 2002 I started <a href="http://threewisemen.ca/">Three Wise Men</a> - a software development company based in Oshawa. While I'd grown the company fairly steadily over 6 years, our staff remained fairly small. The news in April 2008 that I might have to take 3-6 months away from the company for surgery and recovery seemed almost impossible.

<strong>The Preparation</strong>

Needless to say, my 2008 was spent not only continuing to grow my business, but figuring out how it would run without me. The year saw some real ups and downs in my mood. I even considered shutting the business down at several points, thinking that it was an impossible task. In the end, some renewed drive led me to rediscover why I started the business in the first place. I couldn't let it fail. I owe this renewal to some key friends and mentors I'd come to know well since I started the company - all entrepreneurs should remember that they don't need to be an island, and either starting or joining a good business "mastermind" group is an incredible help dealing with business challenges, large and small.

My ultimate solution was focusing on systemizing and documenting my business. I joined a formal business coaching program geared towards owner-managed businesses which helped organize my thoughts, and I leapt ahead writing down and organizing everything about the business I could think of. I hired someone to help with sales and business development, and my most trusted co-worker (I can't bear to call him an an employee, he's an integral part of the business, a natural if somewhat reluctant leader and is entrepreneurial himself) rose to officially manage all production operations. I also offered official part-time positions to two of my key contractors who I'd also rather be more involved in the company.

In October, the specialist at Sunnybrook declared that he would be unable to do the procedure at his hospital, but had arranged several of his patients already to have the procedure done at the <a href="http://www.cdha.nshealth.ca/">Victoria General / QEII Hospital</a> in Halifax. We agreed, and scheduled an appointment in Halifax with the surgeon there to discuss the procedure. Turns out the procedure is only currently available in Canada from Halifax and Calgary.

We didn't know how long it was going to be between the consult and the surgery, so we travelled to Halifax at the end of November on a 1-way ticket with no idea when we'd be home.

I have to give special thanks here to Francis, the wonderful woman who put us up while we stayed in Halifax. She is the cousin of my wife's Mom's friend and lives just north of Halifax proper in Lower Sackville. Turns out Halifax has an excellent transit system and the bus ride from Lower Sackville to the hospital was only about 45 minutes during the week. Francis was a warm and welcoming host, and life would have been so much more complicated without her.

As great as the doctor at Sunnybrook was to speak to, the doctor at Victoria General was even more reassuring. He spoke in great detail (and drew pictures!) about what I should expect. We didn't know specifically how far the disease had progressed so there were many possible outcomes. He discussed the complexity of the surgery, all of the different decisions he might have to make on-the-spot during the procedure, how long it might take me to recover, and what the impact would be on my quality of life afterwards. We decided to move forward despite the risks (there's always risk with any complex surgery, and this one takes the cake).

The surgery was scheduled for the end of January, so we returned home for Christmas to spend time with the family.

Thankfully, my preparation on the business had gone well and the office was running cleanly without me, so during December and January I spent little time there. I got a little bored in January (hey, what can I say, I'm a geek!) and I took on some programming work to help the guys out. I was happy to have the mental distraction.

Oh, and I should probably mention I'm a hardcore gadget geek. For example, I have our DVD collection at home archived to a USB hard drive I keep attached to our Sony Playstation 3 so that we can leave the DVDs in the basement and watch what we want on TV without running around looking for them (or having them get left laying around and get scratched or eaten by the dog).

Knowing I'd be spending weeks in the hospital, I transcoded our movie collection to a lower quality so they'd take up less room on my iPod Touch and I could fit more movies and shows onto it. I also picked up some extra TV series on DVD (the only way to watch TV!). The plan was to have my wife sync my iPod with my laptop, which would replace shows that I'd watched in the hospital with new material every few days. Happily even Season 4 of Battlestar Galactica was released a few days before I had to fly out for surgery.

<strong>Surgery</strong>

The word was, I should expect to be staying 3-5 weeks in the hospital so we booked another 1-way flight to Halifax on January 24, 2009.

When I was admitted to the hospital I was put on "contact measures", a sort of quarantine because I'd been at Oshawa General Hospital for more than 24 hours within the previous year. This actually worked out for us, as I got a private room for the night before surgery. The staff were wonderful, and arranged a cot so my wife could stay with me in the room, and even found a way to get me some free TV for the night. We met several of the doctors through the day who would be involved in the surgery, each giving us the opportunity to ask questions and tell us about each of their roles.

As part of the surgery involved my bowel, I did have to drink another 4L of the bowel prep liquid that evening. Not my favourite stuff, and it took me until almost 8pm to finish it so I had a bit of a restless night with lots of diarrhea.

The morning of the surgery, I had a shower and was ready to go when they came in and got me around 7am. There was a little more time spent in the surgery waiting area, but before I knew it I was being wheeled into the operating room. I slipped onto the narrow surgical table and put my arms onto the special rests, and was put to sleep.

My parents and sisters arrived at the hospital while I was in surgery, and waited with my wife in a special waiting room. We were told the surgery would take between 10 and 20 hours, and it turns out I took 17 hours total. The main surgeon and his assistant were present the entire 17 hours, while other specialists came and went for each their own portions of the procedure. It was a bit of a grueling wait for my wife and family but the staff kept them up to date on the progress as best they could.

Basically here's what they did (in no particular order):
<ul>
	<li>removed my right colon and some lymph nodes around it, thankfully my left colon was fairly lengthy and clear of disease so I got to keep it</li>
	<li>fashioned a new pouch at the end of my small intestine and attached it to the remainder of my colon</li>
	<li>removed my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_omentum">greater</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesser_omentum">lesser</a> omentums (the fat on the inside of your belly)</li>
	<li>removed my entire <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneum">peritoneal lining</a> (protective lining around the inside of your abdomen)</li>
	<li>removed my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spleen">spleen</a></li>
	<li>removed my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gall_bladder">gallbladder</a></li>
	<li>removed a thin outer layer from my liver</li>
	<li>filled my abdominal cavity with chemo fluid and "stirred" me for 2 hours (no idea what that means!)</li>
	<li>created a temporary <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ileostomy">ileostomy</a> so that my bowel has a chance to heal (plan to reverse at 6 months)</li>
	<li>the incision took 59 staples to close, with 2 more sets of 3 covering incisions on my right abdomen</li>
	<li>They put 2 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson-Pratt_drain">Jackson-Pratt drains</a> out my left abdomen for drainage</li>
</ul>
I was quite lucky. I was able to keep a great deal of my colon, which means I will have normal bowel function after my ileostomy is reversed. And, the tissues removed and sent for biopsy came back normal or with only "nonviable" cells. It was as the doctors suspected during our consults, the amount and progress of my disease was certainly on the "good" end of the spectrum.

My family says when they saw me after surgery, I was very swollen. I was also quite a sight with all the various tubes and IVs sticking out of me. For IVs I had a line in each hand, and a central line in my neck with several feeds. I also had a catheter with a bag, an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasogastric_intubation">NG tube</a> down my nose with a pump to drain my stomach into another bag, the two Jackson-Pratt drains on my left side, my ileostomy on my right side, and oxygen to my nose.

The next 3-5 days were a complete blur. While I know I spent 3 days in the ICU (Intensive Care Unit), and another 3 days in a "step-down" unit (1/2 way between Intensive Care and a regular ward) before I eventually hit the regular ward I only recall a few certain events.

One was on the day after surgery. I was awoken by two male nurses who asked me how my pain was (horrible!). Then, they said it was important for me to move around - so they were going to keep giving me painkillers until my pain was gone. I thought, "Yeah right" but they did it. After several shots my pain was somewhere else, and I stood - mostly on my own even. Not only amazing after that surgery, but amazing given that I was so high on the painkillers that whenever I closed my eyes I got lost in the most amazing hallucinations. They had me sit in a chair, where I got to see my sisters and my parents and my wife for the first memorable time after surgery.

The hallucinations were crazy, and went on for days. Visually, they seemed to only manifest when I closed my eyes, but they were auditory as well - and they happened all the time. It was kind of funny, I thought my IV pumps and those from other patients were talking to each other and to me. I don't think my eyes focused both in the same place for the entire time.

They set me up in the ICU with an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incentive_spirometer">Incentive Spirometer</a> (mine didn't look like the one in the linked picture) - a device through which you inhale trying to move enough air to raise a little ball for a few seconds at a time. It's amazing how much your lung capacity is reduced. These first few days I couldn't do anything with it.

<strong>Recovery</strong>

When they moved me from the ICU to the step-down unit, they had to change the central IV line in my neck (something about incompatible with equipment in the step-down units and the wards). It didn't hurt, but it was a little freaky as I lay there under just a local anesthetic feeling them poke around at my neck and stitch the new apparatus down. They also switched me from manual as-requested injections of the "Diloted" painkiller to morphine via a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient-controlled_analgesia">PCA</a> pump. With the PCA pump, you get your own button you can press for an immediate small dose of painkiller, and it's regulated to only allow you to fire it so often. The best thing about it is that it was through my IV so I got a break from the painful injections - they left my arms sore and bruised.

I didn't know what my specific PCA restrictions were, and while I was awake and could see a clock I'd tend to click it every 10-15 minutes. It was a bit strange at night though - I couldn't see a clock, and they just said to click it when I felt pain, which was pretty much all the time. At least one night I know I used a ton of it without realizing and the IV pumps around me seemed especially chatty.

Once in the step-down unit, I became more aware of what was going on around me. I became more aware of my wife at my side every day, mostly reading or stitching as I slept. We didn't interact much, but it was a great comfort nonetheless to have her near. I started doing some regular things like brushing my teeth, and washing a little. Moving around was still a huge ordeal because I still had all 9 of my hoses and tubes sticking out of me, along with 2 IV poles full of pumps. I was being given <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_parenteral_nutrition">TPN</a> (2 bags, one a yellow fluid and the other a white milky fluid for nutrition), <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heparin">heparin</a>, morphine via the PCA, and a variety of other medications on a periodic basis. They took the pump off my NG tube so my stomach just drained on its own.

I got better with my Spirometer, got up to 1/2 strength. I did not yet understand how critical this activity would become for me and didn't practice it as much as I should have.

About a week after surgery, I was finally stable enough to be moved to a regular nurses ward, and within a couple more days things really started happening.

First, they took me off my PCA machine. I was sorry to see it go, but was happy that I could manage with less painkillers which meant I was more and more aware of what was going on around me. For the first time since before surgery I could start to focus both my eyes in the same place.

Within a couple more days (around day 10), they began removing tubes. At one point I found it more comfortable with my NG tube plugged (the one to my stomach), and they decided it was time to come out. They took it out and my catheter at the same time both of which were painless. Shortly after they took the two Jackson-Pratt drains from my left side (the tubes into my abdomen were very long and quite uncomfortable when pulled out). They even took out my central line - which was uncomfortable, but not painful. They took me off the TPN and put me on a basic fluids IV.

With my improved ability to focus and concentrate now I was very thankful for my prep work and planning with my iPod. It was a great help to pass the time watching some familiar and favourite movies and catching up on my favourite TV shows. Turns out that spending over $12 / day for 30 days on the hospital TV by the bed would have cost me almost as much as my iPod Touch.

Around day 11 I ran into a bit of trouble, and I blame not spending enough time with the spirometer and practicing my coughing. My lung capacity was so much reduced I simply couldn't clear a tickle from my throat. It shouldn't have been a problem, but I spend a couple nights where the tickle made me try and cough, but I couldn't effectively do it and eventually started gagging which then turned into vomiting. I was still not quite mentally there so I didn't fully realize at the time what was going on, plus my abdomen felt so different I couldn't sort out what was nausea, hunger, pain from my incision, or pain inside. So when this occurred the nurses didn't quite know what to make of it and I ended up on an anti-nauseant, which in hindsight wasn't really what I needed.

The nurses thought that maybe the NG tube was taken out too soon, I didn't really know at the time what to think. The doctors weren't convinced however because I had stated that I did feel better with it plugged. I think the doctors were right and I do fully blame not doing more lung exercises and better preparing myself for such a simple thing like a tickle in my throat.

Also around day 11 they started me on clear fluids - jello, apple juice, cranberry juice, chicken broth, tea. I savoured my jello like the finest steak. For the first several days I stuck to very small then increasing amounts of the juices and jello, then started to venture to the broth. The broth scared me a little because it had bits in it (wasn't perfectly strained) and they tickled my throat sometimes. Around day 17 they upgraded me to full fluids, which got me milk, oatmeal and cream soups. Then on day 18 I was upgraded to soft foods, which got me dry cereal, an apple muffin, cheese, shepherds pie and stews, and dinners like mashed potatoes, green beans or squash and roast beef or pork or broiled chicken or fish.

On day 14 the physiotherapy nurse started coming around regularly and I started walking and sitting more regularly. I started on a walker and after a couple days was walking on my own. I was working my way up to 3 walks a day up and down the hall. At this time I was only occasionally on an IV so I really appreciated the freedom being able to walk unencumbered.

The ET nurse came by and I got my first training on my ostomy. She explained everything about it and changed the pouch for me, and said there would be a few more visits where I would eventually be changing it myself. From this point on I was expected to empty it myself, which meant getting up to the bathroom, measuring its output, and marking it on my chart. It seems such a simple thing, getting up and going to the bathroom on your own, but I hadn't done it in over 2 weeks. I had to get used to getting up when my body needed me to rather than just when I felt like it.

Since I wasn't on any IV nutrition, I think they wanted to get me onto actual food as quick as my body would let them. And it worked, during my third week in the hospital I started to gain strength.

Until my next issue cropped up that is - which was spiking potassium levels. This was probably the most frustrating thing for me, mostly because of the way they handled it. I don't know that there was any other way they could have, but it was frustrating nonetheless.

Normal potassium levels in your blood are something like 3.6 to 5.1 (this varies a little in the medical community I think). Mine was spiking between 5.3 and 6.0. Apparently if it gets to 7, you start to get some arrhythmia in your heart (scary). The normal treatment was this absolutely horrible liquid drug called Kayexalate. It was very thick, chalky, brown, with that slight fake fruit flavour you get sometimes in medicine. The first time they brought it to me, the nurse was so apologetic and I knew I was in for a treat. I had just had my first stew (chicken and vegetable) for lunch. I tried the fluid and it was so thick I gagged on it and completely lost my lunch.

Every day my potassium came back high, and every day they brought me 1/2 a styrofoam cup of the kayexalate. My wife suggested a popsicle, and it turns out that was the trick for me finally getting it down, which was basically tiny sips with a popsicle in between.

Kayexalate works by binding to the extra potassium and then passing it through your bowel. For me this translated into constant diarrhea, which basically meant my ostomy was liquid all the time and needed constant emptying. I was up every few hours day and night to the bathroom, which was exhausting. I don't think at this point I was getting the nutrition I needed from my food because everything just went straight through me. As a result the strength I had been gaining seemed to slip away from me, and I ended up spending more time in bed.

The doctors had been fairly happy with my progress and were making noises like I might be able to go home soon. We started to talk about flight plans, but didn't tell the family. As it turns out, until that release is actually signed and you're leaving the hospital, it's tough to count on when you're actually going home.

Blood clots are a concern when you're lying around in a hospital bed all day. Since surgery, I was wearing TEDs (tight stockings to keep clots from forming in your legs), on 3 Heparin shots per day, plus Aspirin and Advil to thin my blood. They urged me constantly to get out of bed and walk around or even just sit in a chair for a while. My reduced strength meant I was able to do this less and less.

Despite the precautions, on day 18 I had a pulmonary embolism - a blood clot, in my right lower lung. In the morning, after breakfast I started to get a spasm in my back. It was very painful and caused my whole body to tense, and my breathing to become more shallow. I tried walking but didn't make it to the door of the room before I had to turn back. After a call to the doctor they prescribed an IV muscle relaxant (Flexural) and it helped some. It calmed down through the morning and started to act up again around lunchtime.

Through the afternoon it got progressively worse. By 2:00 the pain was constant and I could barely breath and they put me on oxygen. One of the senior nurses had a hunch and put an extra IV in me in preparation for any medication they might need to give me. I was gasping and taking the tiniest breaths as fast as I could while then ran tests. I had an EKG and an X-Ray at the bed, and they wheeled me down to the 3rd floor for a CT scan. They quickly identified the clot and had me up to the ward and on a Heparin drip pronto on the extra IV line.

The muscle spasm confused things a little, I truly thought that's all that was wrong with me. And I guess while it's not common it can happen along with a clot. Thankfully I hadn't gone home yet, and my nurse was totally on the ball.

For the next 2 days they took blood 3 times a day and adjusted the Heparin drip accordingly so that it could dissolve the clot. My back was still spasming and I still found it hard to breath but it got steadily better over the next couple days.

By day 22 my INR (blood clotting factor) was at therapeutic levels and they switched me to Warfarin pills.

My potassium was still spiking, though less often, and occasionally my body was able to process food properly. I was very frustrated being on the Kayexalate but the doctors couldn't pinpoint what was causing my potassium to spike. Their theory was that due to my high white blood cell and platelet counts cells were dying off and spilling extra potassium into my blood. Tests on my kidneys came back normal. One of the doctors from Medicine tested a theory that the Advil I was on might be causing it so that was discontinued.

I was gaining strength again now that the Kayexalate was less frequent and my small bowel was starting to work better. My body was processing food better, and I had more energy and got back up to my 3 walks a day and spending as much time as I could out of bed.

I even went down to the cafeteria to sit with my wife while she had her lunch a few times. It was a longer trip than just walking down the hall, and was a nice change of scenery. By this time, 3 1/2 weeks in the hospital, I was starting to feel a little caged.

Around day 26 they decided to hammer me hard with Kayexalate and try to push my potassium levels down as far as they could. They gave me a full cup at a time for a couple days to try and do this, but it didn't really reduce it that far. Luckily by this time I had worked out a trick, they seemed to bring me the Kayexalate right after my meals (breakfast / lunch), but instead of taking it right away I'd wait until a couple hours after I'd eaten. This let my body process the meal better and helped with my gaining energy.

On day 28 I got a day pass, and my wife and I walked down the street from the hospital to Smittys, a nice independent restaurant a bit like Golden Griddle. The walk was fairly long and my hips got a little sore, but I had a great lunch. I ordered off their Seniors menu and had bacon, an egg, and 1/2 waffle. I was starting to feel like a real person again.

On day 28 the doctors also started talking about going home again. I was feeling pretty good, and especially after my day trip I figured I was ready, but was also a bit nervous. My wife booked a flight on day 31 in the morning and we crossed our fingers.

On day 29 I saw my surgeon for the last time. We talked about my recovery, flying home, reviewed what to expect in the next few months. He reiterated that my recovery was very good, despite the setbacks.

<strong>Going Home</strong>

On day 30, I was released. It was a very busy day, I saw the ET nurse for the final ostomy training, I saw a doctor from Medicine for my warfarin training and to get my prescriptions and a few extra Warfarin pills to last me until we could get our prescriptions filled at home. I saw one of the doctors on my surgical team for a final checkup and a few more immunization shots, and we gathered all of my stuff together in preparation to leave. By lunchtime all was said and done, and after I had my last hospital meal we stopped at the nurses station and said our goodbyes.

We stayed that night at a hotel near the airport. There was free Internet access at the hotel and I was able to use Skype on my laptop to call family to save the hotel phone bill. Dinner was a bit of a challenge because none of their meals fully fit my dietary restrictions, and they didn't have any Tylenol (I had no pain medication at all, in hindsight I should have asked for some Tylenol and maybe a Morphine pill for the trip home). The night was a little restless, the bed was flatter than I was used to, I had to change my ostomy appliance for the first time without assistance, and we had to get up at 3:45am Halifax time to catch the shuttle bus to get to the airport and catch our 6:30am flight.

The morning was long, up at 3:45, shuttle at 4:30 to the airport (bumpy bus ride, it was very uncomfortable). I got a wheelchair at the airport, and we were settled at the gate at 5:00am. None of the airport shops were open, so I still couldn't get any tylenol until 6, and then we boarded. We flew on Westjet and the 2.5 hour flight was not bad. The seat was comfortable enough (we were in the 3rd row) and unlike the bus there was no jostling around so it was reasonably comfortable. My wife's dad picked us up at the airport and we had an hour's drive home, which was a little bumpy and uncomfortable but not nearly as bad as the shuttle bus.

There's something magical about being home after an ordeal like that. Beyond finally seeing my kids again. I think it's true that I've recovered faster and easier since I've arrived home. Maybe it's that I could finally relax. Maybe it was the reduced stress of having my own bathroom or wearing normal clothes, or my own bed. Maybe it was my wife's cooking and getting back to our normal diet.

When I got home, the first thing I did was weigh myself. I was 215.5 lb before flying out for surgery, and 174.5 lb after returning home - 41 lbs lost.

Now, after almost 3 weeks at home, I'm able to make short trips to the store, walk for about 15 minutes before my hips hurt, and can do simple things like wash my own hair and put my own socks on. Stuff you really take for granted until you can't do it.

<strong>Final Words</strong>

From here on in, I play the wait and see game. There will be regular visits to Sunnybrook and regular scans for the foreseeable future now as they monitor my abdomen and look for any recurrence.

My business is stronger than it has ever been, despite this building recession, and I attribute that fully to the strength of the staff and the preparations I was able to make in 2008 to assist them.

The whole experience worked out very well for me, all things considered. I know this was a combination of my age and good health, and lots of prayer.

I wish you all good health. I saw the mild side of cancer - and it pains me to think of all the people, some whom I've known, suffering or taken by this terrible disease.]]></content:encoded>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Your father passed on your story to me and I will be sure to give my mother a printed copy.  My mother had mentioned that you had been sick, but I certainly had no idea that it was to this extent.  Although my memories of my Oshawa family are vague - usually surrounding big Ukrainian weddings in the early 70's - your story brought tears to my eyes as I am of similar age with two young children.  I have experienced how difficult it is when sickness interrupts your life and how long stays in the hospital puts everything into perspective.  Take care and I hope a speedy recovery.
Enjoy the lovely Spring weather - I hope that it is here to stay.]]></wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Thank you so much for sharing your story. It's wonderful hearing the facts rather than imagining what was going on. Cancer to me has and is like this evil jack in the box that keeps popping up. It took my mom earlier in my life, my sister had breast cancer, Dad prostate, it took my mother in law, the week you went out east saw 2 more "discoveries" in my circle of friends &amp; family. It's just sickenning. But then you describe your fight back. This thing wasn't going to beat you. No, instead of shutting down your business you used it as an opporunity to change it and make it stronger. Your situation  challenged people around you to step up, mostly likely changing them. You are a perfect example of that saying, that saying "that which doesn't kill you makes you stronger". I am honoured to know you and am excited about what you'll do next.]]></wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hi Steven and Sharon &amp; those three girls

I picture you from the past all standing straight,tall and healty and I picture you again like this. Steven I admire you courage and your strength and Sharon I know that it takes an equal amount of courage and strength to sit by Steven's bed side and watch the process unfold not knowing what will come next. I want you to know that you have been in my thoughts since Sylvia told me about the start of your ordeal at the end of last year. To Margaret and Bill and your sisters who all take this journey with you may you all be blessed with an invisible cloak of strength to support each other. It is times like this that you find out so clearly how lucky we are when we have loving families. 

By the way tell you mum that those African Violets that I was able to get going from her instructions have just bloomed. Marg its a sign of new life for you all. And by the way Steven I can't twitter you, in fact I am so out of touch with the technological world that I don't even have high speed internet!!! I even tried a rocket stick (Rogers) but since we can't get cell phone service here it didn't help. I even sent a letter to my MP suggesting that they spend some of that infrastructure money to get good services to rural communities. But who lidtens to me.

Love you

Ann]]></wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hello Steve and family;

I just read your account and I am feeling a rush of many emotions.  First off, thank you for writing your account, it makes a real difference not only for all of us fighting PMP (I was diagnosed November 2006, getting treatments at MD Anderson Cancer Center here in Houston) but also for our friends and family.  

Like you, my cancer was discovered through my appendix - I passed a kidnet stone, the doc wanted a CT scan to make sure there weren't more stones, they noticed something wrong with the appendix and while removing the appendix the surgeon found the tumors.  I was extremely lucky, they caught it early enough that I only lost the appendix, and the prognosis is cautiously optimistic, with the tumors being treated chemically to keep them from growing - the theory is that if they don't grow beyond a certain size they won't metastasize - maybe, don't know, hope for the best, all phrased in comforting technical terms which sound fine until Dr. Lambert (now Mansfield, Dr. Lambert went back to Massachusetts) reminds me that I should never forget that the tumors are there, like biological mines which could go off never, or anytime they choose.  Even so, I feel guilty whenever I hear about some of the fellow PMP 'belly button club' members whose fight ended all too soon, while I got off with a couple minor surgeries and a drug regimen. 

Telling your story is as heroic as your fight, which deserves praise and respect.  

Thank you.]]></wp:comment_content>

I was originally mis diagnosed with Ovarian Cancer, had surgery and now 6 years later still play the wait and see game with increased pain and bloating from the fluid. Any info you can provide me on your medical team would be very appreciated.  
Take care and keep focusing on the postive, I am sure with your mindset you will heal and continue to enjoy all that life is giving you. Never underestimate the power of home and family - especially your wife.]]></wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hello Steve, 
 I was looking for more information about this "mystery disease" because someone I know was just diagnosed, and I found your story.  I am completely moved by your strength and obvious dedication to learning everything you can about all of the medical care you recieved.  I am a nursing sudent in Winnipeg, and I am completely inspired by everything you wrote.  Inspired to teach my patients and their families, to follow my intuition, and to always treat the person, not just the disease.  Above all, my eyes are opened about the healing power of family support and how the stress of being in the hospital can hold you back from healing at times.  I will always remember your story, and I feel that just knowing it will make me a better nurse.  So, I sincerely thank you, and I hope the people I care for and their families do as well.  Best wishes to you and your family!]]></wp:comment_content>

His surgery was 21 hours long and was in the hospital for 79 days due to compications.  He was refered to the Dr. in Halifax from a Dr. in Sunnybrook was well.  We live in Kingston Ontario so I completely understand the ordeal that you and your family have been through.  You were lucky enough to have had your wife with you.  I had to stay in Ontario with our 2 girls.  We are now awaiting for the results of his 1 year CT scan. Thanks for sharing your story.  I wish you good health!]]></wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hi Steve,
 Its good to read you account of your battle with PMP. I live in the uk and I have just been diagnosed. Yesturday the hospital rang with my latest CT results that have confirmed PMP and that it has increased since the last CT. So the Sugarbaker operation is a must for me now, just not sure when. My family is pretty devastated and we are all trying to come to terms and prepare ourselves for whats to come. I too have started a blog to try and track what goes on in the hope it might help someone in the same predicament.
Good luck for the future and I hope you stay PMP free.

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hi Mary Ann,

Good luck for your sister - only a few days away from her appointment. Dr G was very thorough with me, and gave me an excellent idea of what to expect, covering a lot of the decisions he'd have to make while I was on the table. It's a scary procedure, for sure, but a few of us on here are living proof this can be beaten.]]></wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hi Stacey-
Thank you so much for sharing your story. I've just been diagnosed with PMP ( from mucinous adenocarcinoma)  and they're referring me to the Calgary centre for a Sugarbaker. Not sure when yet, but the scariest part was trying to imagine the surgery and the aftermath. Thank you SO SO much for sharing this, as it will hopefully help me and my family prepare better for it. 
I'm also an entrepreneur, so you have given me some hope and ideas on how to keep my business alive while I am dealing with this. Thank you again...!]]></wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[So good to read someone else's story.  After months of having problems with my bladder, I was diagnosed with ovarian cancer after an ultrasound scan.  After a radical hysterectomy, I was diagnosed with PMP.  I have since had cytoreductive surgery and HIP and 4 days of EPIC. I'm now 9 months out from my operation and still feel like I'm on the road to recovery - it's been a long 9 months too.

One of my coping tools has been to read other people's stories and not feel so alone!  Thank you very much for sharing this story.]]></wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hello.  I was so happy to find your story. I was diagnosed with PMP in October 2009 when I underwent emergency surgery to remove my appendix. I was then referred to Dr. Mack in Calgary where I underwent surgery in April 2010.  I live in Ontario and my children were 14 and 17 at the time so while my husband was there for the surgery he could not stay. My story is very similar.  They removed my appendix, gall bladder, ovaries, uterus, omentum, part of my bowel, part of my liver and part of my diaphragm. I also had inter-peretonial chemo therapy.  Your story is so familiar.  Originally I was told that I would have a two year life expectancy but I am feeling well. I am curious to hear how you and others are doing.  I am always happy to talk to others if I can help in any way.  My email is peikre@sympatico.ca.]]></wp:comment_content>

I am extremely healthy at the moment and hope you are too... but am struggling with putting it all behind me because.  Your perspective helped.  
I really needed to find some words today...nutrition books weren't cutting it.  So, thank you for taking the time to post this and for your positive spin on it as the 'mild side'.  I will try to keep this with me.  All the best to you and your family.]]></wp:comment_content>

Our journey through this battle with PMP has begun, my husband has been referred to Halifax for his surgery and to the same surgeon that treated you. I cannot thank you enough for giving us the information about Dr. Giacomantonio, the cancer specialist in St. Johns did not hesitate to refer us. Dr. Giacomantonio had just given a lecture at Memorial university 1 week prior to our consultation. Everything is happening quickly now and we know that hte road to recovery is in sight. I will keep you updated on our progress. Again, thank you for sharing your experience...all the best to you.]]></wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hi Steve,
  I have a simular story as well. My Appendix burst May 29 2010. The surgon decided to remove my appendix at a later date Feb 3 2011. They discovered adenocarcinoma cancer from a piece that they removed from my bowel where the appendix use to be. Not knowing the extent of the cancer spread,on April 5 2011 they removed my acending colon and 18 nodes. Where they discovered that my Liver, Adominal cavity, peritonie and 3 nodes have cancer. It spread this far in less than a year. I'm still recovering from the surgery on April 5th 2011 and I am doing very well. I have been refered to Dr. Giacomantonio and hope to see him very soon. I noticed that the removed your spleen and gall bladder. Was your cancer adenocarcinoma? Did it spread to the Gall Bladder and spleen or was the removal of these a precaution? I'm also 40 years old with 2 little girls and have no idea how successfull this proceedure is. Did Dr. Giacomantonio give any indication on what his success rate was? My doctors are very certain that I will need the Sugar Baker proceedure as well. Any other advice you may have will be appreciated, like a good place to stay for my Wife in Halifax.

Thanks again for posting your experiences. This is a rare situation and hearing other peoples experiences is very informative and gives me hope. Also, it sounds like Dr. Giacomantonio may be a good choice and an experienced doctor to get me through this bump in the road.]]></wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hi Jeff,

Yup, it was adenocarcinoma. It hadn't spread, we'd caught it quickly thanks to the initial tumour bursting through my appendix. It's 3 years now since my sugarbaker. I'm down to annual ultrasounds at Sunnybrook with Dr. Law in the Odette Cancer Center, and everything looks really good for me.

An experience like this is life-changing and awakening. I'm Stacey now, transitioned to female, after 30 years of hiding and denying who I am. Treasure the life you have.]]></wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hi Christine, I hope you are doing well.  I am sooo frightened for my sister Cathy who , hopefully, will be a candidate for the Sugarbaker procedure.in Halifax.  She is scheduled to meet with the surgeon on January 4, 2012.  I would love for her to speak with you, if you are willing, so that she gets some insight into what she can expect..  I am so encouraged by your words that you were and hopefully continue to be extremely healthy now.  She sooo needs to hear this!  Would you be willing to connect with her? Please let me know..at peace.42@hotmail.com .All the best to you in dealing with this nightmare!]]></wp:comment_content>

What you went through has got to be one of toughest battles that anyone could every go through.  God Bless my friend, reading your events brought back alot of memories.  Memories I hope you and I or anyone else who has already gone through this will never every have to go through again.  We have a long life ahead of us and last but not least, STAY POSITIVE.  That's the best medication anyone can ever have!!!]]></wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Dear Steve,

My husband is going through your experience right now - we are at Day 17 and I truley appreciated your insight into your experience - We have ended up in Calgary and have been very happy with the excellent care of both the surgeon, his team and the nursing staff.  Reading your story gives me a better understanding of what he is feeling - I especially laughed as you recount your "special morphine trips" - my husband had a similar experience with the landscape changing every time he closed his eyes.  We wish we would have been able to read this before surgery - we both went into this with some delusions - he is a strong healthy 50 year old man in the best shape of his life - we didn't anticipate how much ground he would lose - every walk is a small victory of strength and stamina!  We too look forward to going home to be with our children and know that recovery is always better when surrounded by the people you love.  Thank you for taking the time to tell your story - it has helped me today.  All the best to you as you continue the PMP journey.]]></wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hi Angela 

Hope you are doing well, I am being diagnose with PMP last month and I am not sure what to do yet. It's so new to me and I am scare. I live in Calgary, I had a small tumor in my left ovary and when I had hysterectomy last April, they discover I have an appendix cancer and they took my appendix the same day together with my ovaries, utero, cervix and phalopian tubes.

Now I will have my next appointment this sept 3rd to discuss my last CT-scan done in August, they said before I need Sugarbaker surgery, but I am not sure how many cases they see it here in Calgary.

Take care and all the best in your recovering

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hello 

I just read your message to Stacey, I am being diagnose with PMP as well since I had a hysterectomy last April, I am talking to doctor Mack from Tom Baker cancer centre in Calgary. I will have my next appointment this Tuesday sept 3 after my last CT-scan to see how much it grows. To heard about other people experiences give me some hope, honestly not sure what to do, as this is a rare condition and I am not sure about doctors experience

Hope you are doing well, take care and all the best in your journey

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I hope all of you are doing well in different ways, finding hope, peace and more reasons to be part of this wonderful world, enjoying every sunny or cloudy morning, enjoying a kiss from your kid or significant other or maybe just enjoying a good book... Anything will count if you really feel love in your hearth.

I life in Calgary and I am going to see dr Mack on sept 3rd to see some new results and a possible surgery as I was diagnose with PMP last month. Life is wonderful and I am planning to stick around, hope to continue reading some update, this always helps.

Take care and love to everyone

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[In following up my "novel" I posted the other day, I found a neat article from Dalhousie magazine published last year that talks about my surgeon and his family.

Dr. Carmen Giacomantonio (he's in the middle in the photo on the front cover of the magazine) was my oncological surgeon in Halifax. He was professional, pragmatic, took the time to explain things to us, and was attentive to our needs. Oh, and managed to stay alert and focused through my entire 17 hour surgery as he was the surgical team lead.

As a patient meeting your surgeon, it's easy to be lost in the professional persona that they present. To forget that they are a person, had their own challenges growing up and establishing their career just like you have. It's an inspiring story, and a good example for our youth that they can truly do whatever they set their minds to.

  <title>Outsource? Yes! Offshore? NO!!!</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I read an <a href="http://www.baselinemag.com/c/a/Outsourcing/10-Functions-Ripe-for-Outsourcing/">article</a> (well, it's more of a slide-show) this morning that just set my hair on fire.

Now I understand that to many folks in I.T., outsourcing is analogous to offshoring. So I can understand at some level why an article like this would be published.

Today we are weathering the worst economic crisis some say since the great depression, but at least in the last 30 years. We are losing jobs at an alarming rate, and entire industries are at the point of collapse.

Hence, my hair on fire. Don't you think we should maybe be a little protective of the jobs we have left?!

I agree with each of the <em>headlines</em> - each discipline mentioned does seem well suited to outsourcing. Each process mentioned is decoupled enough from internal business operations so improvements can happen outside the core organization in a controlled fashion.

However, I vehemently disagree with much of the reasoning stated in the body of the slides. I'm only going to pick apart the first two slides because they're closest to my heart and expertise. Anyone else with their hair on fire want to tackle the rest? :)

1 - Application Development

My company's core expertise so I couldn't agree more. Definitely starting small is a good idea because you want to ensure you can work well with the team you've chosen. They need to prove to you that they can deliver, reliably. This means that they can communicate effectively with you - they understand your needs, they can communicate their challenges and questions to you in a way that you understand. This also means that they are competent in managing your project and the inherent risks in software development, they hire competent developers, and they manage them competently.

These are not easy things to achieve. I personally believe they are easier to achieve in smaller organizations - a group may achieve it within a larger organization but it doesn't necessarily mean that your project will be assigned to such a group. With a smaller organization you know you're dealing with the best team, but they may not be available exactly when you need them unless you put them on a retainer.

2 - Testing

Now, an <a href="http://adam.goucher.ca/">associate</a> of mine would probably be more articulate about this, but I'll take a crack because we do a lot of testing - it is an integral and critical component of successful application development.

If you think communications and understanding is important for software development, that's nothing compared to communications and intuition required for effective testing. And intuition is so incredibly culturally oriented I can't imagine this happening effectively offshore.

Look at testing something like Twitter. Robotically you could ensure that the post you enter is the post that's published. Intuitively however you could ensure that 140 characters is enough to get a typical social message across. Intuitively you could think that it might be a great idea to update your Facebook status from your Tweets, and you might explore how to do that. Intuitively you might discover a new way to craft an XSS (Cross-Site-Scripting) security attack.

Now you could break testing down into many areas, certainly there's more intuition required for exploratory or "kamakaze" testing than for simply following a defined procedure like a robot. There is intuition required in making defined procedures. I'd argue that if you're paying people (internally or outsourced) to be robots, you'd do better paying people to automate the process to improve your error margin. Start with the people you were paying to be robots, you may find they have the best ideas for improvement.

There, the flames have subsided a little. Do consider outsourcing to reduce your costs. Don't automatically go offshore assuming that you'll get the best value. Don't assume that the best price is the best value.

I heard it said once, "If 80% of software projects are doomed for failure anyways, if we offshore those and save 50% we'll be much further ahead!".

If 80% of Three Wise Men projects failed, we sure wouldn't be where we are today. I fully attribute our excellent success rate to our people, our ability to understand and proximity to our customers, and our methodologies.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>What You Want vs. What You Need</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[People are inherently bad at making this distinction. We want lots. We don't need so much. I want a chocolate bar. I really don't need it. I want a new computer. I don't really need it.

We're also very good at convincing ourselves that our wants are more important than they ought to be.

Before I bought my first Mac laptop, I was a staunch PC user. I was Mr. Thinkpad. I simply couldn't imagine getting by with anything less than a 17" display and 1600x1200 pixel resolution. When you see <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2009/03/26/pc-to-mac-i%27m-cheaper/">people shopping for computers</a>, they often get something like this jammed in their heads too - a "requirement" that is often a non-starter. What I discovered, AFTER I made the leap of faith, was that the Mac did so well with what it had I found myself being more productive on even the bottom-of-the-line Macbook - for reasons ENTIRELY DIFFERENT than what I originally imagined.

At Three Wise Men, we see this a lot. In fact, our Agile practices and tenets dictate focusing on building "the least possible thing that will work" so that <em>wants</em> don't overrun a project - which in software can get pretty expensive. Once you have something that works (perhaps uncomfortably, perhaps not so efficiently, perhaps a little ugly) THEN you focus on making it better.

You can't improve something you don't yet have. And until you have it, you simply can't accurately imagine what might make it better.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>The Concept of Millitasks</title>
  <link>https://svetzal.wordpress.com/2009/04/03/the-concept-of-millitasks/</link>

  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Since I've been back at TWM and getting involved in the day to day operations again, and I'm back on task to formalize our procedures, something has been striking me lately.

Big tasks get in the way of other big tasks unless you break them down. Then you can tend to get more than one thing done by doing mixing the small tasks up.

This is intuitively obvious to most. Don't drive to the store, buy a hook, go home, hang your picture, drive back to the store, buy some wood, go home, build that shelf. You mix the two bigger tasks together to accomplish them together more quickly than you could have consecutively.

Big is a matter of perspective, though. A task typically is comprised of several steps to perform (make tea = boil kettle, put teabag in cup, pour boiling water into cup, wait). Each step can be broken down into component pieces like hand movements and so on.

On a computer, the smallest millitask might be a machine language instruction. In transportation each revolution of a tire.

When it comes to programming, the process of breaking a deliverable (say a website, or an application) down into its individual tasks to assemble can be a very long and drawn out process. In fact, because the time taken to analyze and break down the program can approach or exceed the time taken to build the program once and for all, proponents of Agile development maintain that breaking down the program shouldn't be done in any detail at all.

This is going to be true I think for any field where you deal with a high number of unknowns and undefineds.

But, even for programming, many millitasks remain the same. You type keystrokes on your keyboard. You boot up your development environment. You update, test, commit your code changes. These individual millitasks are known quantities, they take about the same amount of time each time, and that amount of time tends to be small.

A problem can arise however when they bunch up. For example, if you have teams or individuals working in parallel on a code-base you need to scatter the millitasks of update/test/commit regularly throughout your day. The further apart those millitasks are performed, the more chance you have of conflict in your code repository and of a developer having to spend undue amount of time dealing with what would have been simple if the millitasks were done closer together.

How about testing? The further apart you test, the larger the potential for broken code to sidetrack you. Testing can be a millitask. Individual tests can be a millitask. Individual asserts within individual tests can be a millitask. Do more asserts more frequently. Do smaller tests to better isolate potential problems.

The cost of marathon code merge sessions, of tearing apart days of coding to fix a broken test, can be enormous.

The goal of your collaborative development environment is to have these millitasks performed as close together as possible and to make them as painless as possible.

To do this -

Make your source-code repository easily accessible and understandable to your developers, and encourage them to commit often. That will help them build small pieces of code, write a test for the code, and commit the test + code. If they're committing less than twice a day something's wrong. Less than daily, something's terribly wrong. Use branches to isolate risky changes but keep them small, evaluate them quickly and get them integrated. If something's taking too long, it's too big and should be broken down.

Use Continuous Integration to make sure as many tests are run as possible as close to your developer commits as possible. Don't let a developer commit as the very last task of their day - if they break the build they need to fix it.

And automate as many millitasks as you can so that they don't become gruntwork or distraction for your developers and they can perform them effortlessly as they go so they don't pile up. Automate branch merges and email team leads on conflict. Automate closing bugs in your bugtracker when the fixes are committed.

Identify the millitasks in your environment and see what should be done more frequently, automated, or done together instead of separately. Find what's eating your developers' time and think about the problem in terms of millitasks, it might give you some ideas.

Also, when you look afterwards (not too long afterwards! that's a millitask!) at certain millitasks you may find they become Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) of your environment as a whole and can help identify problems. Certainly you can monitor when they become too far apart and could cause general inefficiencies but you can also use them to identify specific blocks like training issues (developer over their head) or environmental issues (disruptive influence), or star employees (never broke the build).]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Continuous Improvement: Tools or Process?</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Any organization who wants to survive needs to realize that they need to implement some level of Continuous Improvement. This is a concept borrowed from the Lean Manufacturing movement, and applies everywhere. You improve, or you stagnate and become irrelevant.

I often run into folks who are absolutely convinced that a new tool will solve their woes. I always try as gently as possible to let them down and help them realize that while a new tool may help but what more likely is broken is their approach to the problem - it's process related. Their old tool may very well fit the new process.

What brings this hope that a tool will help is twofold - one is the tool proponent and their promise of increased productivity. While this likely holds some truth, what's more likely is that <em>the tool embodies new, more successful processes.</em>

Do you need the tool to do this? Probably not! Does the tool help? Perhaps.

<em>But why not adopt the processes on their own to make sure they work for you before investing in the tool?</em>

Here are some ideas of processes in software development and tools that can support them. Remember, it's more important that you adopt the process than these individual tools.

<strong>1. Effortless Communication</strong>

You want to remove as many barriers to communication between team members as possible. Remember too that your team may be larger than you initially think - programmers, project managers, QA people, business stakeholders, customers, etc. This team DOES extend beyond your organization and you NEED to accommodate that.

Each group of individuals will have their own preferred methods of communicating. Some will prefer email. Some will prefer the telephone. Some will prefer instant-messaging or group chat.

I count this as a larger process that is a composite of smaller processes. Here are some of the processes that we practice:

<em>a) Daily status (medium size process)</em>

A standup meeting, 5-10 minutes, during which developers discuss with themselves and their team lead what they're doing and what they plan to do. This is also where they bring up any roadblocks that need to be removed ASAP like knowledge gaps, infrastructure problems, additional guidance or clarification.

We do this on a conference bridge so managers, customers and stakeholders can listen in. There are no minutes or notes taken, this is busy work. If folks want to know what's going on day by day, they dial in.

Tools: Telephone, conference bridge

Risks: If developers do not participate, they lose touch with milestones and day to day progress, causing duplicated efforts or delaying tasks

<em>b) Iteration status / showoff (weekly or bi-weekly, large size process)</em>

An in-person meeting between developers, managers and stakeholders. This must be done face to face in order to facilitate effective non-verbal communication and reduce misunderstandings.

This is typically done at a customer site (if they have the meeting facilities and white-board space) or at our office.

The purpose of this meeting is typically two-fold - i) show off the work done in the previous iteration and ii) plan the work to be done in the next iteration.

The result of this meeting is the task list for the next iteration.

Tools: Meeting room, white-boards, computer(s)

Risks: Stakeholders need to understand the work that's been done to-date, if they do not attend time is wasted on duplicating items discussed during this meeting in writing.

<em>c) Interim communications (small or tiny size processes)</em>

During an iteration, various interim communications must be made effortless. These include discussion between developers (who may be working together or distributed) and discussion between the team lead and managers and/or stakeholders.

Communication directly between managers and stakeholders and individual developers should be developer initiated only. Stakeholders need information on what's going on so they need to talk to the team lead, attend iteration status meetings, and/or listen in on daily status meetings (not often exercised as they are typically very technical).

Tools: Instant messaging (open over MSN, Yahoo, AIM or closed over  a private Jabber server), group chat (open over a public IRC server, or closed over a private IRC server), telephone, conference bridge (multiple stakeholders / managers / team lead).

Risks: Team lead must communicate road blocks to managers and stakeholders, and managers and stakeholders must act on these road blocks (something isn't getting done until it's removed).

<strong>2. Issue tracking (small size process)</strong>

Invariably as a project progresses, items that arise that can't be dealt with right away need to be recorded so that they can be revisited and/or confirmed addressed at the iteration status meeting.

Tools: bug tracker (Redmine, Trac, any Wiki)

Risks: issues fall through the cracks, stakeholders feel they're not being taken seriously

<strong>3. Source-code control (tiny process)</strong>

Developers need to be able to work on the same code-base without getting in each others way - this is what source-code control accomplishes.

These tools need to be well supported by all developers on all the platforms they use. For this reason we typically shy away from any commercial and platform specific source-code control tools as they typically leave some developer out in the cold.

Tools: subversion, mercurial, git

Risks: time wasted merging changes manually

<strong>4. Testing automation (small size process)</strong>

As developers build code and tests to ensure the code functions, these tests need to be run constantly. The sooner a developer can be told that their change broke something, or that a test was insufficient, the more quickly it can be addressed and the less it slows the project down.

Tools: hudson, cruise-control

Risks: time wasted chasing deeply broken code

Notice that for a software development company, most of those communication tools don't sound particularly high-tech. That's because they're purposefully not. The more complicated or monolithic your tools, the more likely they are to fail you - people won't use them or they're more likely to be unsuitable in certain situations.

Also notice that the more technical the worker, the more software tools are used. The best technical workers have an innate ability to automate the "soul killing" tasks, or the things that piss them off.

Also, note that the smaller the process the more critical it is that it gets done with relentless regularity. This dovetails with my <a href="http://svetzal.wordpress.com/2009/04/03/the-concept-of-millitasks/">previous blog about millitasks</a>. While every one of these processes however are critical in our company to successful project delivery, it's the small and tiny ones that pose the most risk to a successful project.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Lately, software project estimation has risen to the surface as a discussion topic at <a href="http://threewisemen.ca/">Three Wise Men</a>. The flurry of smaller proposals we've done lately has driven the discussion forward.

There are several elements at play here:
<ol>
	<li>Smaller businesses have lower tolerance to wavering budgets than larger businesses</li>
	<li>Small web applications are often perceived as a commodity, like sugar or crude oil</li>
	<li>Small estimates are swayed more heavily by variances caused by unseen circumstances (ie. a 1-day spike is 20% of a single-developer 1-week-sprint project, vs. 3% of a three-developer 2-week-sprint project)</li>
</ol>
See something in common here? Yup, you spotted it. "Small".

I happen to like the word small, but sometimes businesses feel intimidated about being perceived as small. Like somehow being small is likened to being vulnerable or incapable.

Why do I like small?

Agility. Technology is an obstacle course at the best of times, a mine-field at the worst.

Communication. Just watch a meeting among 3 people versus a meeting among 30.

Focus. Fewer distractions and more personal responsibility.

Every software project should start small. With great agility, excellent communication, and sharp focus the smallest software project can change the world.

So, with this lofty goal in mind, consider the 3 challenges I mentioned above. Is there any hope for small projects?

For sure, but perhaps not where you think it might be.

For discussion, I'll propose two ways to estimate. The first way, which seams like it should work, is what is done in many other industries.

A good friend of mine is buying a new house. It seems pretty simple - the builder has several house models they've built hundreds of times before. They know exactly what it's going to take to do the framing, run the plumbing, the electrical, to shingle it. They've done it hundreds of times. So when they give you a price of $250,000 - that's exactly what it's going to be and they know it.

With software, it seems complex. Technology changes constantly. Years ago we used to joke half-heartedly and say "Hey guys, should we use the same technology on this project as we used on the last one?" - the reality was we couldn't. The market's drive to make more efficient and feature rich tooling and frameworks always push us forward as we strive to more wisely allocate our customers' budgets and provide them better value. While the applications looked pretty similar on the outside, their foundations shifted constantly. So when you never build something the same way twice, because to do so would be a disservice to your customer, how can you possibly know how long it's going to take?

Well let's take a look at these two points in more detail.

My friend is going through right now what I'll call the secondary pain. Up front, the house was $250,000, cut and dry. But they wanted 9' ceilings. Oh, well, with 9' ceilings the standard kitchen cupboards are going to look ridiculous so they need an upgrade. Oh, and you want a better shower? That'll be another $3K. Oh, and laminate countertops aren't your preference? Well, we have granite for somewhere between $5K and $10K more. Oh, and we realize you thought this was going to roll into your mortgage except we need 30% of your $30K in upgrades up-front. Hope you can accommodate that.

With software, you are met with tremendous initial uncertainty. Until you start accomplishing small tasks, then one by one the project falls into order. You'll dodge and weave around challenges. As you progress along your project, you'll see what has been accomplished and what is remaining. You'll be able to play with it, discover new ways you can make it better. As you approach the end of your budget you will begin to more clearly see what you can accomplish and what you're going to have to cut out until the next phase. Don't take your eye off that budget though, it comes up fast.

You see the difference there? You have this well-established system with perceived stability up-front that entices you forward. You jump in, and then you see the sharks. Or you have this pool of cold scary-looking water you can't see into, but once you jump in and spend some time there it doesn't seem so cold and you begin to have some fun - but if you're not careful hypothermia sets in.

Now I'd like to challenge one last point above. The bit about software having tremendous initial uncertainty.

If every successive custom application is built upon this shifting technology landscape, how can you possibly find order in that?

Well, to be honest I'm not sure :) but I'll point out some recent observations I've made.

First, let me point out that I firmly believe software projects cannot be accurately estimated until they're complete. The larger the project, the less accurate you can get. Thankfully by this principle, smaller projects are naturally a little easier to pin down.

I've always held onto a simple idea that most small software projects can be estimated using certain metrics. Once you measure out what's involved, you should have a reasonable sense of how long it's going to take. Of course, this doesn't take into account new technological hurdles, or the odd developer "Eureka!" that shaves a day of coding off because they found or invented a new way to do something.

We've also recently begun playing <a href="http://www.planningpoker.com/detail.html">Planning Poker</a> for new project proposals. We take our interpretation of the initial project backlog and start throwing down estimates in a team setting. Often this goes pretty smoothly, but sometimes you end up with some real insightful discussion around the table.

And strangely enough, the estimates we get from both approaches tend to come out reasonably close.

I suspect there are some pretty simple answers to this actually. A strong architectural minded developer will juggle quite a bit in their head when evaluating a task. They're going to be at least subconsciously evaluating similar metrics to those we extract methodically. What they have that our spreadsheet doesn't though is a strong instinct for the "tough bits". Those rough edges you just can't pin down, because you read a blog post 3 months ago warning you about something, or maybe it just smells wrong.

And for this reason, we have begun to favour Planning Poker as a means of establishing initial budget expectations for our larger projects that go beyond simple database tables and CRUD (Create - Read - Update - Delete) manipulation of business data. In fact, for both large and small projects we've adopted a mix of each technique to improve our estimates.

So there you have it. Start small. Don't be afraid of initial uncertainty. Watch the features unfold and watch your budget. 4 points to help make any software project successful.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Securing Data on a USB Drive on Mac OS X</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I was looking for a good way to encrypt data on a portable disk on my Mac, and was surprised at the range of misleading information out on the Internet. So, it inspired me to write this post in hopes that I can save people the pain and aggravation of figuring it out for themselves, or getting turned off and deciding that it isn't possible without buying extra software.

If you want to save private data on a USB drive, or actually any disk, it's actually pretty easy and doesn't require any extra software. The encryption is reasonably strong too (well, as strong as your password is, so pick a good one!).

So, let's get started.

First, open up Disk Utility. The easiest way is to hold down Command and hit the spacebar to pull up the Spotlight search and start typing "Disk Utility" until it shows up in the list under Applications, then press enter to launch it. The long way is to open a Finder window and go to your Applications Folder, open up the Utilities folder, then double-click on Disk Utility.

The way this works, is you're going to be creating a "Disk Image" that is encrypted. This is actually going to be a file on your USB drive. When you plug in your USB drive it'll open up but you won't see your private data. Instead, you'll see the Disk Image file. When you double-click that file, it will ask you for your password. If you enter the correct password, it will then "Mount" - which means your Mac will figure out it's a disk image and make it act like its own disk.

Any data you store on that new disk will be encrypted and stored on your USB drive, making it (here's my favourite term) "cryptographically infeasible" for someone else to open it without your password.

Once Disk Utility opens, click on the New Image icon at the top of the window. You'll get a dialog box with a few options - let's go through them.

So, because this is a file, when you clicked on "New Image" you get asked where to put that file. Make sure you pick your USB drive on the left and enter a filename, call it "Private Disk". Now the important part are the options underneath the file browser starting with Volume Name. This is the name that appears in the Finder for the disk, call it "Private Disk" too.

Under Volume Size, enter Custom, and then enter a smidge less than your USB drive can hold (or smaller if you want to also store un-encrypted data on it). So if you have a 4GB (4096MB) drive, use something like 4000 MB.

Under Volume Format, leave it at Mac OS Extended (Journaled).

Under Encryption, make sure you pick 256-bit AES encryption (more secure, but slower). <em>If you forget to change this, your data won't be protected!</em>

Under Partitions, select Single Partition - Apple Partition Map.

Under Image Format, pick sparse bundle disk image.

Then, click on the Create button. Your Mac will go ahead and create that disk image for you.

When the image is created, another dialog will pop up asking you to enter a password to protect the disk and to verify that password. Make sure you pick a good password, but one you can remember. If you forget your password, your data is LOST! If you don't pick a good password someone else might guess it.

The dialog box will tell you what it thinks of your password - if you click on the "Password Strength" link it will suggest some good passwords for you, but don't forget to memorize them. And fer cryin out loud, don't do something silly like write the password on your USB drive :)

And that's it! Quit the Disk Utility.

You'll find your disk image already mounted, look for Private Disk (or whatever you entered as the Volume Name) on the left-hand side of a finder window. To eject your drive, click on the eject button beside Private Disk, then on the eject button beside your USB drive. From now on, you'll have to remember to eject BOTH disks when you want to remove your key and take your private data with you.

When you plug your USB drive back in, it'll open and show you the private disk image. To get to your private files, double-click on that private disk image, wait for it to mount, and there you go!]]></content:encoded>

  <title>CRTC, Hear Our Plea</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Canadian ISPs are trying to make a point to the CRTC. Here's a <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2009/06/13/canadian-isps-need-y.html">Boing Boing article</a>, and the <a href="http://support.crtc.gc.ca/crtcsubmissionmu/forms/Telecom.aspx?lang=e">CRTC feedback page</a> so that you to can make a difference.

My message to them follows.

The practice of bandwidth throttling is damaging to the Canadian media industry and effective distribution of Canadian digital content.

The sad truth is that peer-to-peer media sharing technologies, despite claims made to the contrary by certain network operators, actually reduce network congestion because they tend to optimize the flows of traffic to avoid bottlenecks. While it is true that there is an overall increase in throughput transferred on a network at large, this increase is localized in areas of excess availability in order to move this traffic away from the bottlenecks.

The real issue remains that root suppliers of content are still unwilling to distribute digital material in the fashion demanded by consumers. As such, some consumers feel forced to obtain these digital materials illegally even in cases where they are entitled to it under fair-use legislation.

Further, we are beginning to enter a time when the digitally available materials can be transferred far faster than organizations are able to produce them. Throttling the transfer of digital materials gives the illusion that there is a much higher amount of activity "on the wire" than actually exists because it takes a longer amount of time to transfer these coveted digital assets. The peer-to-peer media sharing technologies attempt to make more peering connections in a vain attempt to increase throughput, thereby exacerbating the problem.

Allowing a network operator to selectively limit consumer access to digital content based upon their own profit-maximizing agenda, when there continues to be no fair competition in the Canadian telecommunications arena, makes our country extremely distasteful to any pioneering enterprise exploring how to resolve the larger content supply issues at hand.

Consumers are caught in the crossfire, as they are figuratively brow-beaten until they become criminals. Worse yet, we have an entire generation of young Canadians who have already been taught, because of these deplorable practices and the archaic state of media distribution, that free file-sharing of copyright content is acceptable and the norm.

As long as we continue to waste time and money allowing these practices, we will continue to stifle innovation and lag behind the rest of the world in terms of telecommunications infrastructure and adoption, so critical to enabling the future of legal and profitable digital media distribution.

I am ashamed that we have allowed this to happen in this country, my country. I only hope that we can correct it before the damage to the Canadian economy that these companies are dealing out becomes permanent.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Java EE 6 and Netbeans 6.8 Released</title>
  <link>https://svetzal.wordpress.com/2009/12/14/java-ee-6-and-netbeans-6-8-released/</link>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[It's finally here, Java EE 6 represents another serious step forward in the core Java server technology stack.

It's kind of anti-climactic though - we've been using some of these technologies as standard on our Java EE apps for so long I forgot they weren't part of the core! Facelets is a big one there, building JSF pages in JSP was awful right from the start, and it's good to see Facelets in the core to bring powerful templating "out of the box".

Also, I've noted the examples in Netbeans are unfortunately just what we expect - way more boilerplate than we'd like to see. But one big difference this time is a lot of it is optional! Too bad the examples don't make it seem so. If you've avoided Java EE because of "too much boilerplate", and are looking at the examples in the Netbeans 6.8 templates, don't be disappointed. It's too bad they didn't take that opportunity to show what the platform can do in this respect.

So here are the important parts of Java EE 6 in our world (for the full list of new things, not just my favourites, <a href="http://java.sun.com/javaee/technologies/index.jsp">look here</a>):

- Facelets support - excellent templating

- JPA2 - much more power in relational object mapping

- WebBeans - more pervasive use of dependency injection for wiring

- JAX-RS - simple annotated restful web services

- EJBs in WAR projects allow for a simple but powerful small app layout

So it's time for me to start evaluating these things. Already have Glassfish 3 replaced my 2.2 testing installation, and Netbeans 6.8 set up as my IDE. It's also good timing for me as I'm doing a lot of prototyping these days for our internal products (Christmas is usually a very productive time of year for me :)).]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Using Java EE 6, Without Java</title>
  <link>https://svetzal.wordpress.com/2009/12/17/using-java-ee-6-without-java/</link>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[So this month, Java EE 6 was released. So many new capabilities are now part of the baseline stack, it's very cool.

After tweeting about how much boilerplate configuration and coding can be eliminated using EE 6, a colleague pointed out that the Java language itself indeed contains much boilerplate code. I realized I'd failed at helping people understand that the Java programming language is today only one of many programming languages you might use on the JVM, and how this relates to classic Java web application development.

I realize that Grails, and JRuby on Rails, and Lift for Scala are all interesting web frameworks. That's not the point of this post - I'm here to show you how easy it is to set up a Maven 2 project using Groovy for code and Facelets for presentation all glued together with Java EE 6 and deployed on Glassfish 3. Oh, and there's a fun bonus for you at the end :)

You can access the full source from <a href="http://github.com/svetzal/GroovyEE6/">my Github project</a>. You will need <a href="http://java.sun.com">Java SE version 6</a> and <a href="http://maven.apache.org">Maven 2</a> set up to compile it. You will need <a href="https://glassfish.dev.java.net/downloads/v3-final.html">Glassfish 3</a> installed to deploy it.

Maven needs 2 blocks in the POM (pom.xml) to be able to build your Groovy code - one to declare the gmaven-runtime dependency and one to have Maven build the Groovy code from src/main/groovy.

The service bean looks like this:

<code> </code>

<code>
<pre>@ManagedBean(name="groovyBean")
@RequestScoped
class GroovyService {
    String simpleProperty = "Nope, this is not a method!"

    def getMessage() {
        "Hello, Groovy World!"
    }
}</pre>
</code>

Notice that in Groovy the Java EE 6 annotations look exactly the same as in Java. The class doesn't illustrate any of the power of the Groovy language itself but as long as you use "bean patterns" - ie. get / set method names - you'll have no problem interfacing with your service from JSF.

Referencing the service method in JSF is as simple as:
<pre>&lt;p&gt;It says - #{groovyBean.message}&lt;/p&gt;</pre>
And that special bonus? Using "ab" to measure pure HTTP transactional performance, under Glassfish 3 my simple page does over a THOUSAND requests per second. Yeah, I know, benchmarks suck. Stay tuned and we'll slow this down a whole lot by tackling some more interesting things like database connectivity and transactional services.]]></content:encoded>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Many thanks for your post.

I've tried and it works good.

I've tried to modify GroovyService.groovy:

import javax.inject.Named;
import javax.enterprise.context.RequestScoped;

@Named("groovyBean")
@RequestScoped
...

Is there any way to run it using CDI ?]]></wp:comment_content>

  <title>Java EE 6, Untestable?</title>

  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Trying to work something out and it just doesn't look possible right now.

Since Java EE 6 was officially released earlier this month, I've been pretty jazzed about it. It represents significant leaps forward in simplicity and developer productivity.

I was so encouraged, I started a couple projects to start experimenting with what I could do with the environment.

Unfortunately when it came time to integrate automated testing, I hit a large brick wall.

It's all well and good to have these nice testable POJOs, but many of the bugs in a system are due to misinterpreting or misunderstanding of the underlying technologies by developers just getting started or not paying attention. If you use JPA2's persist() on an object for example, can you be sure your configuration will conclusively save the linked objects as well? This is the kind of thing we build integration tests for.

I use Maven 2 for all of my Java / Groovy project builds, and it has also been enjoying much broader support in the industry. As a result, developers are now more cognizant than ever before of their underlying dependencies. This is a Good Thing™.

The typical Maven 2 dependency on the Java EE 6 web profile APIs would look like this:
<pre>
&lt;dependency&gt;
  &lt;groupId&gt;javax&lt;/groupId&gt;
  &lt;artifactId&gt;javaee-web-api&lt;/artifactId&gt;
  &lt;version&gt;6.0&lt;/version&gt;
  &lt;scope&gt;provided&lt;/scope&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
</pre>

The jar referred to here contains all of the annotations and APIs you should need, from JPA 2 to Servlet 3. Unfortunately I can't find any implementations to play nicely with it.

So with the API included above, you'd think it would make sense to say find a JPA implementation like EclipseLink (the default JPA 2 implementation in Glassfish 3) and include it as an embedded implementation for your unit testing. However if you include a block like this:

<pre>
&lt;dependency&gt;
 &lt;groupId&gt;org.eclipse.persistence&lt;/groupId&gt;
 &lt;artifactId&gt;eclipselink&lt;/artifactId&gt;
 &lt;version&gt;2.0.0&lt;/version&gt;
 &lt;scope&gt;test&lt;/scope&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
</pre>

You end up with your tests failing with the following exception:

<pre>java.lang.ClassFormatError: Absent Code attribute in method that is not
 native or abstract in class file javax/persistence/Persistence</pre>

It appears that in some way the EclipseLink implementation is not completely filling in the blanks in the API.

I've dug through the Glassfish project (it too is a Maven 2 build) and don't have enough familiarity to draw out a nice clean implementation jar to include in my own project's test scope... despite several attempts.

I haven't given up, but unfortunately this has blown a couple weeks of productivity and I'm going to have to abandon my current projects in order to have something to show for all this time I've been spending. &lt;sigh&gt;

Comments extremely welcome on this one, I'd love to get past this impasse.]]></content:encoded>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hi Gordon,

This is an excellent point, and no, I'm not 100% sure it's providing all the APIs I need :)

I _do_ know that this dependency is provided both by Netbeans when creating a Maven EE 6 project as well as by the org.codehaus.mojo.archetypes / webapp-javaee6 Maven 2 archetype so I've been assuming (hoping) that it is the "sanctioned" dependency that I am looking for. This however is just an assumption.

I _also_ know that this dependency is the only one I need to build an application that deploys cleanly in Glassfish 3 using EclipseLink as the persistence implementation - and works beautifully.

From what I've found out there, the exception I see when running unit tests outside Glassfish is caused by an API jar on the classpath that has an incomplete implementation on the classpath. This is actually very far from - and I absolutely do not mean to imply - that EclipseLink is in any way a deficient implementation of JPA 2 - my testing thus far has been performant and wholly functional. I believe it means simply that there is some glue that I'm missing that a proper Java EE container would have that would provide a more complete execution environment.

My only goal at this time is to provide what seems widely claimed, and seemingly obvious - a Java EE 6 project that does automated testing using embeddable technologies like EclipseLink and a single API jar dependency to use for deployable builds inside Glassfish as well as automated tests outside Glassfish.

I believe that this is simply a matter of getting my dependency tree right, but damned if I can find the right mix :)]]></wp:comment_content>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[OK, so some progress has been made.

I've abandoned using the Maven dependency indicated by Netbeans 6.8 and the org.codehaus.mojo.archetypes / webapp-javaee6 Maven 2 archetype and instead had to cobble together my own discreet dependencies from hints and clues. I would have much preferred actual documentation and facts :(

However I have reached my initial goal which was to use the same API jars marked "provided" for compilation and testing, and EclipseLink as an embedded JPA2 implementation during testing.

My Maven 2 project descriptor now has the following dependencies marked:

<code><pre>
&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;javax.persistence&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;persistence-api&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;2.0&lt;/version&gt;
    &lt;scope&gt;provided&lt;/scope&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;javax.servlet&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;servlet-api&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;3.0&lt;/version&gt;
    &lt;scope&gt;provided&lt;/scope&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;javax.ejb&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;ejb-api&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;3.1&lt;/version&gt;
    &lt;scope&gt;provided&lt;/scope&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;

&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;junit&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;junit&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;4.7&lt;/version&gt;
    &lt;scope&gt;test&lt;/scope&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;org.dbunit&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;dbunit&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;2.4.7&lt;/version&gt;
    &lt;scope&gt;test&lt;/scope&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;org.postgresql&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;postgresql-jdbc3&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;8.2-504&lt;/version&gt;
    &lt;scope&gt;test&lt;/scope&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;org.eclipse.persistence&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;eclipselink&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;2.0.0&lt;/version&gt;
    &lt;scope&gt;test&lt;/scope&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
</pre></code>

I have two persistence.xml files, one in src/main/resources for production deployment that refers to a container managed datasource, and one in src/test/resources for testing purposes. The testing descriptor refers manually to all Entity objects to be registered with JPA and ties directly via JDBC to my test database.

The API jars can likely all come from Glassfish v3, specifically the following files:

modules/javax.ejb.jar (assumed to be EJB 3.1 api)
modules/javax.persistence.jar (assumed to be JPA 2 api)
modules/javax.servlet.jar (assumed to be Servlet 3.0 api)

These binary files are covered by the CDDL or GPL licenses so I expect they're distributable but I'm hoping one day they end up on a public Maven repository somewhere so people can use them directly from their POM instead of having to manually install them in their local repository.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[OK, found another brick wall :)

So if you recall, I have a Maven 2 build. I now have discreet API jars isolated for JPA 2, Servlet 3, and EJB 3.1. This allows me to build with a single dependency tree for production and still provide a suitable environment for automated testing by providing EclipseLink as a JPA2 implementation under my "test" scope.

My next challenge came when I wanted to use <a href="http://java.sun.com/javaee/6/docs/tutorial/doc/gjbnr.html">CDI (Contexts and Dependency Injection)</a> to start wiring up components for use in my Facelets templates. If you recall, CDI allows you to do things like name your components and place them into specific scopes (session, request, conversation, application) so that they are lazily instantiated on demand when your web templates need their services. It also provides automatic dependency injection so when your components require other components to work, they can have themselves automatically created and injected by the container.

You'd think that because CDI largely came from <a href="http://seamframework.org/Download">Weld</a> that the API jar would be reasonably simple to isolate. Strangely however some of the annotations I need (@Named, actually the whole javax.inject.* namespace) are completely missing from the Weld 1.0.0 and 1.0.0.SP1 distributions, and they're buried in Glassfish in the weld-osgi-bundle.jar in between all the implementation stuff.

The <a href="http://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/final/jsr299/index.html">JSR</a> for CDI points to the Weld 1.0.0 distribution so I'm SNAFU'd there looking for javax.inject.*, and I've been unable to find another useable jar out there in the wild that contains this part of the API.

Of course, it's fully present in the javax / javaee-web-api / 6.0 dependency which <a href="http://svetzal.wordpress.com/2009/12/26/java-ee-6-untestable/">completely FAILS</a> when used with EclipseLink JPA 2 implementation, which is why I moved away from it to begin with.

How can you expect anyone to get anything done in an environment like this?]]></content:encoded>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Thanks Matt, I'd found the javax.inject dependency just hadn't blogged yet about it. Follow-up post is coming.

Thanks Sahoo, I'll examine the Maven build and test classpaths a little more deeply on my next round.

If everyone hasn't already gleaned, my goal here is to provide a lighter-weight testing environment that will fire errors back sooner than booting up a whole container a-la junitee - I realize my focus has remained somewhat narrow (only JPA 2 testing out-of-container) but I still think useful.

I'm not quite sure even where to start to get dependency-injection functionality bootstrapped in order to test injection order, never mind transactional behaviour. By this point, I may be back to in-container testing.]]></wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Sorry, I should have read your other blog as well before commenting. Yes, those API jars are intentionally kept implementation-less so they can NOT be used at runtime. We expect users to use them for compilation only. User should use classes provided by the implementation. I don't know why this jar is used by maven during testing in spite of you specifying  scope. May be you can turn on verbose flag while running maven and see what classpath is actually used.]]></wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Apparently the javax/javaee-web-api Maven artifacts aren't the real deal -- they're 'stubs'... basically, it means that they're really great for easily managing your compile and provided dependencies, but not they break entirely when you need to do something like mock them out with Powermock...

Why that is I'm not particularly clear on, but the fix seems to be in finding an actual implemention... for example, I've had this issue with the Servlet API in the past, and the solution was to add the following to my dependency list:


  org.glassfish.grizzly
  grizzly-servlet-webserver
  2.0.0-M2
  jar


Not a very nice solution, I'll be the first to admit -- frankly, I'd like a better explanation as to why the javax artifacts don't work for this... in the meantime, you can make it work with something like the above...

first i thank all who have been contributing in java.i am new to EJB.
my problem is :i tried to build remote application using Ejb ,
1. i build entity bean from  datebase 
2. i tried to build session bean from entity class for remote AP.
then error="EJB Remote Interface depends on JPA AEntity classes. JPA Entities are inaccessible if they are located in mode." i used netbean 7.2.1.

as i was making a research over a week ,i stormble over this solution 
1 .that i should build class library 
2. create entity bean in the class library
3.add the class library to the already created ejeModule
4.create persistence Unit
5.create session bean for entity class in ejbModule .
Great i used that to create my Remote application .

BUT:when i tried to build my ejeModule i keep on seen this malignant error

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Something has been weighing heavy on my mind for a while now. Years, in fact. I didn't realize it however until the past few weeks while delving back into interactive media for the book publishing industry.

In the mid to late 90's I spent a lot of effort on interactive media for desktop computers and commercial television. There were promising technologies and great multimedia development platforms, and out of this open specifications emerged like SMIL (Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language) and SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics), while HTML (HyperText Markup Language) flourished.

Interactive tools were built upon the shoulders of visionary products developed in the late '80s and early '90s like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperCard">Hypercard</a>, Macromedia Director, and <a href="http://www.atarimagazines.com/compute/issue124/P204_1_REVIEWS_AMIGA.php">AmigaVision</a>.

SMIL was quickly adopted by Quicktime, Windows Media Player, and Real Player - the trifecta of heavy-weight vendors with a vested interest in interactive media. It was very promising that these vendors could all gather around this common open format for interactive media.

This was at the same time as Flash was also starting to take hold in the market.

Then over the following 10 years, SMIL was virtually assassinated from the landscape.

There's a lot that <a href="http://ukwebfocus.wordpress.com/2008/11/18/why-did-smil-and-svg-fail/">can be written</a> about SMIL and SVG's failure in the industry. 

Quicktime X no longer opens and runs SMIL files (Quicktime Player 7 does, and it's <a href="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/technologies/interactivity/smil.html">still in the spec</a>). Quicktime on the iPhone won't handle SMIL. WYSIWYG SMIL editors now are nowhere to be found. Evolution of the SMIL specification slowed to a crawl. The once potentially vibrant ecosystem around open standards has withered to nearly nothing - with obscure projects like <a href="http://www.ambulantplayer.org/">Ambulant</a> remaining as last-chance efforts to keep an open format available to the world for interactive media.

My problem with Flash isn't its capabilities - they are impressive. It is with the fact that it is a vendor proprietary format, with a closed ecosystem. Adobe makes the flash player. Adobe makes the flash development tools. Sure some other companies provide streamlined development tools based on Adobe's APIs (like <a href="http://www.swishzone.com/">SWiSH Max</a>) but Adobe controls what they can and can't do with those APIs.

Apple is rallying behind emerging and open interactive formats like HTML, which have recently been trying to introduce new features like Video and provide a richer standardized interactive format - strangely what the world seems to be crying for all the time we let SMIL wither and die. Can you imagine what things would be like if HTML were a vendor-proprietary format? What would the world be like if Microsoft owned HTML? Adobe? Apple? Commodore?

In HTML / JavaScript you can build basic iPhone apps that look and feel just like native iPhone apps. For years now I've argued that most of what you see in Flash has been available using Dynamic HTML techniques pioneered 10 years ago - and standardized and popularized years ago among savvy web developers with libraries like <a href="http://script.aculo.us/">Script.aculo.us</a> and <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>.

What we continue to lack are modern versions of the great pioneering multimedia tools. Classic HTML tools don't cut it - we need tools that average computer users can grasp, that they DID grasp 20 years ago but we seem to have lost. That a teacher can sit down and use to build an interactive aid for students. That a marketing professional can use to build an interactive product demonstration. That aren't tied to a vendor proprietary format. That will play natively in a web browser as intended by the author.

So I say to Apple, help us remember that Flash is just ONE option in the world of interactive media. Help us to remember that websites don't need Flash to be highly interactive and graphically rich. Help us to remember that we need tooling and support for open standards and to realize the interactive multimedia vision that seemed so clear 20 years ago.

Ignore the whining from the complacent and lazy market, stick to your guns, and KEEP FLASH OFF the iPhone / iPad!]]></content:encoded>

The Ipad would be useless longterm to me unless I could jailbreak. No multiasking? Eeek. They need to think a little less controlling, but good luck on that.]]></wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Richard,

Flash may not offer a way for a search engine to index the pages(although I've never personally looked into it), but Silverlight 3 actually does have something in the SEO department via navigation framework and deep linking. As for accessibility I'm not sure what compliance you would be looking for.. I see some results from the w3s and Silverlight 2(old), and has been improved since Silverlight 2(Silverlight 4 is in beta).

Unfortunately Expressions Blends is PC only:(]]></wp:comment_content>

  <title>iPhone Applications and Intermediate Tooling Considered Harmful</title>
  <link>https://svetzal.wordpress.com/2010/04/11/iphone-applications-and-intermediate-tooling-considered-harmful/</link>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I have to say, I admire Steve Jobs for taking the hard line on so many issues. It isn't easy, and he's sure taking the flack for it these days. I'm reminded of Derek Sivers' <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/derek_sivers_how_to_start_a_movement.html">recent TED talk on starting a movement</a>. Apple generally isn't afraid to be the lone crazy out there.

I've been involved as a user and as a developer in projects in the past providing intermediate tooling. That is, a software tool that produces a template or even finished code for a different software tool. From Maven archetypes for Java to code-generators for UI, from Flash generators to iKVM.

Believe me, it's no bed of roses. About all they've ever accomplished is to allow someone to take what they know about Environment A and find some mapping of that to what they don't know about Environment B.

The trouble is, the mapping between Environment A and Environment B is "lossy" - and on a platform like iPhone it's like JPEG compression at 10% quality.

You could argue that the intermediate tooling can "narrow down" its focus to a subset of a particular problem domain. Like a game generator that builds "Sim-X" style games, you just change the calculations some and provide different graphics. Likely it could get a much better match between Environment A and Environment B by not trying to be everything to every developer.

The problem with this approach is you get a very homogenous set of Apps being published that all basically look and work the same.

Then there's the issue of keeping the intermediate tooling up to speed with the latest enhancements in the target platform. There's an inherent lag here because you can't QA or sometimes even start building your tooling until that platform is in production. By then you've got frustrated users in the field who can't use the features they want, or worst-case have crashing generated applications because your generator built "bad" code.

Jobs doesn't want a bunch of crappy or duplicate applications in his App Store. I wouldn't either. He wants useful applications with a high-quality end-user experience. Would you rather fish through a sea of 15 crappy apps to find the 1 gem in the mix that was hand-tooled from the ground up, or would you rather just grab the 1 gem and get to work?

I'm reminded of one of our favourite quotes at TWM:

<em>"To become over-familiar with one weapon is as much a fault as not knowing it sufficiently well."</em> -Miyamoto Musashi

We always urge our developers to expand their base of knowledge. Every new programming language and environment they learn makes them a better programmer in <em>all of the environments</em> they know.

<strong>If you are so tied to one environment that you refuse to learn well any other, you are not reaching your potential and I guarantee you are producing substandard work even in the environment you feel you have mastered.</strong>

If you want an environment of useful and successful software, you don't lower your standards to get it - you raise them.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>An American iPad in Canada</title>
  <link>https://svetzal.wordpress.com/2010/04/24/an-american-ipad-in-canada/</link>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[My sister was so proud, she knew I wanted an iPad and she really did too, so on her recent trip to the US, she got one and texted me right away... So naturally I asked her to pick up 8 more for me and my friends but we settled on her just picking one up for me.

For all of 10 minutes she had something that I desperately wanted, and she knew it drove me nuts :)

So this is day 1 with my new iPad. The 64GB wifi version.

Setting it up has been pretty painless except for one annoying thing - it won't even open the app store on the device because it is connected to my Canadian iTunes account. Oh, and it took an hour to sync all my stuff to it.

Other than that things have been going fairly well with it. It is super responsive, easy to type on, and since the last iTunes update I have 8 apps that have already been updated for the device. I am writing this on the iPad version of the Wordpress app.

With regards to buying new apps, it gets a little tricky. Of course you can't buy apps from the US iTunes store with a Canadian credit card, so I've been exploring what's available in the Canadian store. Because the iPad isn't released in Canada yet, there is no iPad section in the Canadian store but iTunes does show you iPad apps when you search.

Searching on the iTunes store for iBook or Keynote come up blank, but I am wondering if I can justify Plants vs. Zombies HD after buying the iPhone and Mac versions :)

The Kindle app was already updated for iPad, but I don't own any kindle books yet. Stanza works but hasn't been updated yet for iPad so it doesn't fill the screen, or is fuzzy if you do.

The Wordpress app was a bit funny because there are 2 apps, both with the same name, one for iPad and one for iPhone and you can't really tell them apart. Luckily when syncing I noted one was much larger and it happened to be the iPad one. 

I've always been very disappointed in the Google app, and was happy for a minute to see that it has been updated for iPad. But alas, it's nearly identical. Too bad it's little more than a bunch of bookmarks for Safari.

Well, that's it for now. Going to go play Plants vs Zombies - the iPhone version zoomed in - which isn't so bad. The larger screen itself makes a tremendous difference in gameplay. The zombies are coming!]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Software Development Is About People</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[We as an industry forgot this for a long time, and I am proud to be part of the movement to bring it back. 

I hear all the time from people about projects being late, features missing, broken or "I can't believe that ever worked" code. Often this is the voice of the customer feeling like they've been "had". That their developer just didn't listen to them. And now they're stuck with something that they didn't want.

This is definitely the symptom of a relationship that didn't exist or just went bad.

I have seen projects do this, even been intimately involved. Projects where the technology that was delivered was even great but the customer relationship falls apart because it missed the mark, or they became so frustrated with the process that they just gave up.

And make no mistake, it was the software developer that failed here.

I've said and heard this so often that it sounds cliché - but the vast majority of time spent on a software development project is figuring out what needs to be coded.

Align what's in your developers' heads with what's in your customer's head. This is easier said than done, but regular face to face collaboration is key here. Two way participative engaged collaboration. Watch for when meetings become one way. You know what I mean, one side talking and the other side nodding giving the illusion that the idea is getting across. Fix this immediately, questions are your best tool here.

If something is said at any time that doesn't fit, don't let it slide! It could be a contradictory requirement, an unspoken assumption, a change in motivation. Stop and talk about it, figure out where it came from. It might just be a bit of ad-lib that is easily discarded or you may need to abort your sprint and have another planning session.

Also, recognize early when it's time to pull the plug. Sometimes a customer is so unfocused that every status meeting they're looking in a different direction. Agile tenets tell us this is ok, they can change their mind at any point and queue those changes for the next sprint, but if they aren't pulling in roughly the same direction every sprint you may be going from Toronto to Montreal via Boston. Maybe you should have focused on getting to Kingston first.

So, take time during a project to connect everyone. Get them talking, honestly and openly. Don't be afraid to look like a fool because you're not. Show your courage from the start and you can avoid the illusion of incompetence later.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Cannibal: A simple Object permissions framework for Ruby</title>
  <link>https://svetzal.wordpress.com/2010/08/17/cannibal-a-simple-object-permissions-framework-for-ruby/</link>

  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I'm proud to announce that we're releasing one of our newer frameworks into the open-source community - specifically under the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_licenses#2-clause_license_.28.22Simplified_BSD_License.22_or_.22FreeBSD_License.22.29">Simplified BSD License</a>.

Cannibal is a permissions framework for object-to-object declaration and querying of permissions or capabilities. It is distributed as a standard <a href="http://rubygems.org/gems/cannibal">gem library through rubygems.org</a>. You can also view the <a href="http://github.com/ThreeWiseMen/cannibal">source-code at github</a>.

So far, Cannibal has done reasonably well for us on various projects. It's syntax could use some improvement but we believe it's fairly expressive as it is - if you have suggestions for improvements, please write!

Basically you declare a class as either an Actor, or a Subject, or both. You do this by including the appropriate Cannibal mix-in:
<pre>class User &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    include Cannibal::Actor
end

class Thing &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    include Cannibal::Subject
end</pre>
Then you declare permissions for your Subjects. For example, if you want any User to be able to view any Thing object, but only want users with the "Administrator" role to be able to edit them, you might declare that like this:
<pre>class Thing &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    include Cannibal::Subject
    allow User, :view
    permission({
        :actor =&gt; User,
        :verb =&gt; :edit,
        :actor_proc =&gt; Proc.new{ |user|
            user.role == 'Administrator'
        }
    }) 
end</pre>
Once declared permissions are easy to query, and read very well:
<pre>if @user.can? :edit, @thing
    ...
else
    ...
end</pre>
As you can see the permissions() method on Subject is still a bit ugly, and is the main reason for the &lt; 1.0 release number. I'm definitely open to suggestions on improving its syntax.

Testing coverage is not bad, though there is some duplication between our rspec tests and our cucumber tests, and there's a ton of refactoring yet to be done, but it's working on a couple pet projects of mine and will be going into production for a customer project or two within the next couple weeks.

Enjoy :)]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Decisions In The Dark</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[We write software <a title="Today" href="http://svetzal.wordpress.com/2008/10/23/today/">today</a>, it's important to always remember this.

Often when we are asked to write software, we are typically provided with a list of "business requirements", constraints under which we need to build it. Some of these are architectural, some are design, some are technological, some are legal or regulatory constraints, some are business goals, and some are expected features.

Depending on the customer, these constraints have received different levels of consideration. A large established business may need a tactical solution under which many constraints are imposed (you must talk to this database, interact with this webservice, solve this problem). A new startup business may have pages full of features they want, but an intense requirement to make money as soon as possible.

The problem is, that every requirements document is incomplete. To the extent that it's been said that the most important information in it is the author's phone number.

One reason for this problem is that often when we write, the words we put down don't always say to everyone what we intended at the moment they were written.

Another reason for this problem is that the requirements document was written at a time at which we knew the absolute least about the project: before it has started (see <a href="http://www.construx.com/Page.aspx?hid=1648">Steve McConnel's "Cone of Uncertainty"</a><a href="http://www.construx.com/Page.aspx?hid=1648"></a>.) Invariably and despite the best intentions and utmost upfront scrutiny, it is incomplete.

In our experience, as you begin working on a project, as stakeholders and developers accumulate knowledge about the project, you discover new information and have the opportunity to clarify many things in your original requirements.

Agile and Lean Software Development tenets tell us that if we defer the decisions we make in a project as late as possible, we can make a more informed decision simply because we know more about the project. The key is finding the "last responsible moment" - an idea championed by the <a href="http://www.poppendieck.com/">Poppendiecks</a>.

The last responsible moment is that point in time when you can make the most informed decision, and when that decision can truly no longer be deferred.

So think back to your project constraints, which of them are truly constraints and which of them are decisions made in the dark?

The idea is so insanely simple, who could possibly make a good decision without gathering as many facts as they can muster?

We should all strive to be more aware of the last responsible moment, we owe it to our customers to ensure that our projects aren't governed by decisions made in the dark.]]></content:encoded>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Great post covering many good points, yet concise. I think the awareness of the last responsible moment goes towards a very dear concept to me that Uncle Bob (Robert C. Martin) been talking about "Craftsmanship". Hence I truly believe that we owe it to ourselves as Professionals that we ensure that our projects are not governed by decisions made in the dark.

We should remember that in some cases we are not in control of all the elements of the Software we are building (end-to-end product), and therefore their requirements goes beyond our grasp. This is specially true when building enterprise integrated solutions (e.g. B2B) where the concept of having "complete" requirements is not reasonable.

It is this Design Tension that Architecture can play a responsible role in managing it by reducing its associated risks that reduce its intended value.]]></wp:comment_content>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://svetzal.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/avatar-2011-06.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-215" title="Avatar 2011-06" src="http://svetzal.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/avatar-2011-06.jpg?w=225" alt="" width="225" height="300" /></a>I’m writing today with some important personal news.

Over the past several years, I have made a number of very positive changes in my life leading up to the most important life change I’ve ever made.

In a nutshell, I’m transgender and have struggled from a very young age with Gender Dysphoria - my gender identity, how I feel inside, does not match my gender assigned at birth. <em>Being</em> transgender is not a choice, but what you <em>do</em> about it is.

After two years of therapy, and a great deal of soul searching, I realized that I could not achieve my full personal potential until I began living my life authentically as a female. As a result, in 2010 I began taking permanent steps towards this end.

After August 1st, I will finally begin living permanently as Stacey Gillian Vetzal. “Steve” will cease to exist.

Initially I realize this may be a little awkward for some. For those of you who have known “Steve” for a while, it will take some time to remember to use female pronouns and my new legal name — and that’s OK.

I already live much of my life as a woman, in fact I have many friends that only know me this way. However unravelling 40 years of socialization as a male doesn’t happen overnight.

The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender">wikipedia page on Transgender</a> gives a great, if academic explanation of the term, but for folks close to me I keep a copy of Joanne Herman's excellent and brief book – <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Transgender-Explained-Those-Who-Are/dp/1449029574">Transgender Explained for Those Who Are Not</a> – for lending. Because transgender describes such a wide variety of people, it is hard finding resources that I actually relate to. I generally discourage people from using Google and the Internet at large to learn about transgender, it's not very helpful.

Unlike many transgender folks, my life is at peace. I have an incredibly supportive family, very supportive friends, and a great work environment. Because I am an entrepreneur my transition is a bit more public than I'd have originally chosen, but when seeking personal growth it's important to step outside your comfort zone.

The reality is I’m the same inner person I’ve always been. My interests are the same, my hobbies are the same, and my work ethic is the same. I will now simply be able to do these things with a greatly improved sense of inner peace and dignity.

I look forward to continuing to work with all of you, and welcome any questions you might have moving forward.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>The Chaos in the Matryoshka</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Those that know me know that I'm not afraid of change. I'm a big proponent of "strong opinions loosely held". When something makes sense, grab ahold, if you can disprove it, move along. Don't become too attached or you'll find you've turned into an apologist.

About 4 years ago I announced I was done with fixed price projects. It was the best business move I ever made.

There wasn't really any change in the amount of money we made on each project. But the spirit of collaboration we were able to bring to customers, stopping the seemingly constant disagreements over what was included or not included, what was a bug or not a bug, just ceased for the customers that understood what we were about. Software development became fun again, fulfilling. We have delivered much better work because of it.

Of course, the odd customer (who we've gotten better at purging) would still want to argue these points. For whatever reason, maybe they grew up in a world of fixed-price contracts, they'd try and turn collaboration into confrontation. Try and change the terms of our engagement.

I spend a lot of time thinking about the whys and hows of this, and I think it comes down to this - they've become blind to the chaos around them.

Chaos is everywhere, and builds on itself. It starts with a poorly understood requirement, snowballs into misunderstood emails and conversations, avalanches into the maelstrom of shifts in understanding.

Chaos is deceiving. It wears a mask of order and alignment. The human brain is brilliant at finding patterns, and it is so tuned to the idea of patterns that it will perceive them where none exist. Countless times, a customer has presented a requirement as a simple thing, we listen, we write it down, "this should be trivial" we think. And then through conversation and examination the mask comes off. Then we find it's like a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matryoshka_doll" target="_blank">matryoshka doll</a>, behind each mask is yet another that appears ordered and aligned. Eventually deep enough into the project we take apart the last piece and voila, chaos.

Real life is messy. Countless times we've had the conversation around the whiteboard where we've just scrapped a really elegant data model saying "Wow, this is awful! If only this business case didn't exist..." We just discovered the chaos in the middle of the matryoshka.

Customers tend to get this. They know their business is complicated. Sometimes they've been ingrained in it so long that they've become blind to the ways in which it is complicated, but when things are drawn out logically they tend to say things like "Yeah, I know it's strange, but that's just the way it is."

The risk in the software project lies in not knowing how deep in the matryoshka the chaos lies.

A fixed-price fixed-feature contract expects the software developer, with little to no prior knowledge of the customer's day to day business dealings, to take on that risk and price the project accordingly. They'll take wild stabs, based on their own prior experiences, sometimes masking it in a thin veil of reason. A fixed-price contract will never reflect the true cost of the software, you've either bludgeoned the business into paying more than they should, or the developer into delivering more than they could afford to (or worse, they walk away).

A target-budget contract has more of a shared risk. The customer accepts that they may not have a "complete" solution at the end, but that it was fairly priced because it cost exactly according to the work that was put into it. The risk on the part of the software developer is simply that they do their job professionally, and engage the customer appropriately to explore taking the matryoshka apart.

Over the past couple years though we've very much enjoyed a more holistic and sustainable approach than target-budget, but that's the subject of another post...]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>1.  Imagine an end-result in only the coarsest detail</h3>
Let's face it, we're all human. We can't juggle everything in our heads, and we don't have perfect clarity on day 1 of a project. You want to get your system in place quickly, and you definitely don't want to waste time playing imagination games for weeks on end writing detailed documentation and pixel-perfect mock-ups that will be difficult for others to understand, and could be impossible to implement.

There is definitely value in a study of business requirements, written project requirements, and simple sketched mockups, but stay high level!

The more you layer imagined details on top of other imagined details, the further from reality you get. Write down and verify your facts, sketch out your vision, and get the ball moving!
<h3>2. Keep and <em>communicate</em> a clear and consistent vision</h3>
It's OK if you realize during a project that your best chance of success means a slight change in direction.

However, be wary of too many or drastic changes in direction - pause your development until you've re-established your vision and reconfirmed your facts. It doesn't make sense to continue spending time and money along any direction to which you're not fully committed.
<h3>3. Stay engaged</h3>
Don't send your development team away on auto-pilot. They will need your help, and you will need theirs - daily communication is healthy. As each iteration goes by, they will rely on you to imagine more and more detail on top of the code they deliver. Imagining the details on top of real concrete running software is what will keep you on track towards delivering your product.

In addition, if you see something going in the wrong direction, the sooner you talk about it with the team the more you'll be moving towards your goal.
<h3>4. Ship</h3>
It's OK if the product is not perfect on day 1. Call it an open beta if it makes you more comfortable, but the sooner you can get your product into the hands of your users, the sooner you will start collecting valuable feedback.

Remember, <em>don't imagine what your users will want, find out for sure</em> by putting the product in front of them.

Sometimes you'll hear the idea of focusing on your "Minimum Viable Product", the simplest product you can build that has some value to your users. How can you fully imagine this without your users' direct feedback?
<h3> 5. Keep the feature set small</h3>
Remember the words of Antoine de Saint-Exupery, “Perfection is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.”

It doesn't take much effort to build something complicated, and it is very challenging indeed to build something simple. It's compelling as the project moves forward to imagine all the extra things it could do. However remember that by and large every new feature you add will make the product harder to use, and more expensive to maintain moving forward. Be very, very sparing.

This includes incorporating user feedback. You will get a volume of feedback from your users, but don't take it at face value. Understand where it's coming from, read between the lines, and either discard what doesn't align with your vision, or re-align your vision.
<h3>6. The Long Haul</h3>
Your software isn't an island. It lives in a world that constantly changes, and as with everything it must either adapt, or fail.

If you approach the project with a single up-front budget and leave nothing for ongoing maintenance, you're ensuring the future failure of your product – it's as simple as that.

Some technologies will be inherently most expensive to integrate from a maintenance perspective. Right now, social platforms like Facebook and Google+ are in constant flux and products that integrate with them can carry the highest maintenance costs as they adapt to what can be weekly changes. But who doesn't want their product to integrate with Facebook these days?

Choose carefully and with your eyes open what technologies you integrate. Some will have a far higher impact on your maintenance costs than others.
<h3>7. Have Fun</h3>
Creating software is a uniquely rewarding experience. When you can see it in the hands of your users, and they appreciate it, it is tremendously gratifying.

But also remember the journey, product life cycles can span years or decades - revisiting the path to maintain and better it should be a positive and pleasant experience. If it's not, you're not going to want to do it.

Everyone does their job better when they enjoy what they're doing. Keep your vision front and centre, keep a positive attitude, treat your users, peers and developers with respect, and it will be hard not to build something meaningful.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[In 2009, I wrote about my experience with PMP.

Since then, I get posts every month or two from others who are going through their own journeys. I'm happy to have provided my perspective, and I thought folks might like to read a follow-up.

My story is a happy one. Three years ago I was laying in bed about this time, wishing the wound from where my stitches opened would heal faster, hating my ileostomy.

Today I'm happy and healthy. I go for annual ultrasounds and chest x-rays now instead of the quarterly CT scans.

I have undergone one additional shift in my life, this experience gave me the courage and conviction to finally come out as transgender. I live now as my felt-gender, as a woman.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Signed and Encrypted Email on OSX and iOS</title>
  <link>https://svetzal.wordpress.com/2015/02/08/signed-and-encrypted-email-on-osx-and-ios/</link>

  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I'm writing this as much for me as I am for you, my fellow netizen.

Signing and encrypting email on iOS is a black art. Get your incense and candles ready.

To start with, I usually use the free email certs from Comodo - https://www.comodo.com/home/email-security/free-email-certificate.php

They're, well, free. That's about all I can say about them.

Each year, when your cert expires, you are issued a new "private key" along with a new certificate. Every fibre of my being screams against this, but hey, most folks don't know how asymmetric cryptography works, so I can forgive most folks for not having this same reaction as I. In my world, your private key is your golden egg. You keep that private, handle it with great care, and never, ever, ever lose it. That private key is your personal identity in digital form.

OK end of rant on that. Moving on.

When you complete Comodo's process, you will download to your computer a file, for some reason they call it CollectCCC.p7s and that's how it hits your downloads folder. This file holds both the private key they just generated for you, and a certificate signed against it issued by Comodo.

On OSX, when you double-click that file it opens up Keychain Access and installs nicely. At that point, Apple Mail is pretty much ready to start signing and decrypting messages from others. In fact, the simplicity here is a bit deceiving because all kinds of things are happening behind the scenes that you might not be aware of, that give you a glimpse at why the h-e-double-hockey-sticks iOS seems convoluted as frak.

In order to get that private key and certificate to iOS you're going to have to do something that I'm still washing off in the shower. You're going to have to email it to yourself.

Here's how:
<ol>
	<li>Open your Keychain Access program (it's in Applications / Utilities - I just use Spotlight, command-space and start typing keychain... it'll show up there)</li>
	<li>Go to Category: Keys and find secure.comodo.com</li>
	<li>One of them (you may have a few) has an arrow that you can fold down to see your email address certificate. Make sure the certificate isn't an expired one if you've been doing this for a while. And for the love of all that is holy, keep those expired certs and private keys otherwise you won't be able to decrypt messages sent to you in years past!</li>
	<li>Right-click on the secure.comodo.com listing with the unexpired certificate underneath it, and go to Export "secure.comodo.com". Choose Personal Information Exchange (.p12) which is actually a PKCS12 file. Enter a good password - when it exports, that's your private key all out in the open there for anyone to peek at and steal your identity.</li>
</ol>
OK, now you're going to have this shiny .p12 file. I hope you're at least using SSL / TLS for SMTP and IMAP/POP, but that's yet another story. Email that file to yourself so you can get it to your iOS device(s).
<div><a href="https://svetzal.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/img_01041.jpg"><img class=" size-medium wp-image-328 aligncenter" src="https://svetzal.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/img_01041.jpg?w=169" alt="IMG_0104" width="169" height="300" /></a></div>
When that email arrives on your iPhone / iPad / iPod you're going to tap it, and install it. You'll need to enter that password you entered on your Mac, and I do hope it's as inconvenient for you to type as it should be. I fact I also hope you mis-enter it a couple times because it's so complicated. And I really really hope you didn't write it down, and I only kind of hope you had to do this process more than once because you forgot what it was between saving the file and getting that email. I'm not that much of a jerk, very often.

Here's what the screens look like as you install your certificate...
<div><a href="https://svetzal.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/img_01051.jpg"><img class=" size-medium wp-image-329 aligncenter" src="https://svetzal.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/img_01051.jpg?w=169" alt="IMG_0105" width="169" height="300" /></a><a href="https://svetzal.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/img_01061.jpg"><img class=" size-medium wp-image-330 aligncenter" src="https://svetzal.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/img_01061.jpg?w=169" alt="IMG_0106" width="169" height="300" /></a><a href="https://svetzal.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/img_01071.jpg"><img class=" size-medium wp-image-331 aligncenter" src="https://svetzal.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/img_01071.jpg?w=169" alt="IMG_0107" width="169" height="300" /></a></div>
You can verify that the certificate is in place if you go to Settings / General /
<div>

<a href="https://svetzal.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/img_0108.jpg"><img class=" size-medium wp-image-332 aligncenter" src="https://svetzal.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/img_0108.jpg?w=169" alt="IMG_0108" width="169" height="300" /></a><a href="https://svetzal.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/img_0109.jpg"><img class=" size-medium wp-image-333 aligncenter" src="https://svetzal.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/img_0109.jpg?w=169" alt="IMG_0109" width="169" height="300" /></a>

<a href="https://svetzal.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/img_0110.jpg"><img class=" size-medium wp-image-334 aligncenter" src="https://svetzal.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/img_0110.jpg?w=169" alt="IMG_0110" width="169" height="300" /></a>

<a href="https://svetzal.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/img_0111.jpg"><img class=" size-medium wp-image-335 aligncenter" src="https://svetzal.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/img_0111.jpg?w=169" alt="IMG_0111" width="169" height="300" /></a>

</div>
Now, go to your Settings, then Mail, Contacts, Calendars, then choose the account for which you had Comodo issue that certificate, then tap Account, tap on Advanced, turn on S/MIME, tap Sign, and make sure your email cert is selected. It's fairly safe to leave Sign to ON and sign all your emails that go out, but once in a while someone may complain about the signature attachment if they don't understand what it is and their email program is dumb and shows it to them.

You might want to encrypt your messages by default, but don't worry - Mail only knows how to encrypt for the people for whom you've explicitly imported signatures... so you won't all of a sudden be sending encrypted email to people that can't read it.

Here are some screenshots of that process:

<a href="https://svetzal.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/img_0113.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-336" src="https://svetzal.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/img_0113.jpg?w=169" alt="IMG_0113" width="169" height="300" /><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-337" src="https://svetzal.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/img_0114.jpg?w=169" alt="IMG_0114" width="169" height="300" /></a><a href="https://svetzal.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/img_0116.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-339" src="https://svetzal.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/img_0116.jpg?w=169" alt="IMG_0116" width="169" height="300" /><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-338" src="https://svetzal.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/img_0115.jpg?w=169" alt="IMG_0115" width="169" height="300" /></a>

And now, you're ready to go into Mail. There's a couple gotchas and things that just aren't that obvious.

<a href="https://svetzal.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/img_0117.jpg"><img class=" size-medium wp-image-340 aligncenter" src="https://svetzal.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/img_0117.jpg?w=300" alt="IMG_0117" width="300" height="135" /></a>First is when you get emails from people who have signed and encrypted it, you get these two little symbols - the seal with the checkmark means it's signed (and you can grab their signature - which you have to do before you can send encrypted email), and the lock means it's been encrypted (only you can read it and only  where you've installed your key and certificate).

Email is encrypted specially for each recipient against their signature. If I want to respond to this email, I must install this person's signature. To do so, tap on their name, then tap on View Certificate, then tap Install. Here are some screenshots:

<a href="https://svetzal.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/img_0118.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-341" src="https://svetzal.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/img_0118.jpg?w=169" alt="IMG_0118" width="169" height="300" /></a> <a href="https://svetzal.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/img_0119.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-342" src="https://svetzal.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/img_0119.jpg?w=169" alt="IMG_0119" width="169" height="300" /></a> <a href="https://svetzal.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/img_0120.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-343" src="https://svetzal.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/img_0120.jpg?w=169" alt="IMG_0120" width="169" height="300" /></a>And now, when you're writing an email to someone you can indicate that you want it encrypted. Just tap on their name, and tap the Lock symbol that appears.

If you get the messages below, this is where things get a bit funky:

<a href="https://svetzal.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/img_0121.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-344" src="https://svetzal.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/img_0121.jpg?w=300" alt="IMG_0121" width="300" height="224" /></a> <a href="https://svetzal.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/img_0122.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-345" src="https://svetzal.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/img_0122.jpg?w=300" alt="IMG_0122" width="300" height="152" /></a>

So what's actually happening here, is it doesn't know what key you want to encrypt the message using, and/or it doesn't have their signature/certificate installed. Make sure you've done the procedure above to install their certificate.

Now, go to your Advanced email settings again, go to Encrypt by Default, turn it on and pick your email address.

<a href="https://svetzal.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/img_0116-1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-346" src="https://svetzal.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/img_0116-1.jpg?w=169" alt="IMG_0116 (1)" width="169" height="300" /></a> <a href="https://svetzal.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/img_0125.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-347" src="https://svetzal.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/img_0125.jpg?w=169" alt="IMG_0125" width="169" height="300" /></a> <a href="https://svetzal.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/img_0126.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-348" src="https://svetzal.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/img_0126.jpg?w=169" alt="IMG_0126" width="169" height="300" /></a>Now go to Mail, create a new email to your friend whose signature you've installed, tap their name, and tap the lock symbol again. This should work now.

<a href="https://svetzal.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/img_0128.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-349" src="https://svetzal.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/img_0128.jpg?w=300" alt="IMG_0128" width="300" height="150" /></a>

Now you can go back to your email Advanced settings and turn off Encrypt by Default. You shouldn't have any trouble from here on in.

So there you have it, it's a bit of a complex dance to do this, but once you've done it things should work pretty good for you.

Don't forget to drag that .p12 file to your trash, and empty your trash, and delete that email both from your sent-items on your Mac, and from your inbox (and, of course, empty your email trashes)!

Through the iOS and OSX versions, Apple has tinkered with how this all works a bit, with each release sometimes introducing a new set of quirks, but hopefully this will do us at least until the fall.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Why a Worker's Cooperative</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[This past weekend I was at the Software Craftsmanship North America conference (SCNA) hosted by 8th Light in Chicago. This is a wonderful conference that each year I manage to drag more of our staff down to experience.

SCNA was a bit of a break for me, as much of my time lately has been going in to setting up The Commons Cooperative, a new organization that I'm building focused on software development services for businesses, entrepreneurs, and what I'll call "social good".

While at SCNA, I was having a conversation with Dave Thomas (@pragdave, co-founder of The Pragmatic Bookshelf http://pragprog.com). I was describing The Commons, and mentioned that we were proud of it being a different legal structure than most companies. Specifically, we are setting up The Commons as a Not-For-Profit Worker's Cooperative.

His simple question was basically, what's the benefit of a cooperative versus a partnership or other traditional business structure?

Not being well practiced in talking about The Commons, I stumbled. I found myself at a loss to verbalize why I was so passionately pursuing this avenue. Since then, I've been thinking about how I want to answer that question.

You see, my current business, Three Wise Men Inc. (which is being renamed to Mojility Inc.) is a standard corporation. I've been running this business for nearly 12 years, and we try very hard to retain a stable staff of developers. We have managed to establish a healthy collaborative culture, with people that care, enjoy mentoring others, and fit very well with the values of the Software Craftsmanship movement.

Now, I'm not the best at business development and sales. From time to time, when business is down, I'm struck with the difficult decision of when and how to lay off excess staff. I have a very hard time with this, we invest so much in our people, both professionally and emotionally. I think this is one of the reasons why our staff is so loyal, and our workforce so stable.

Now, think of the job of a CEO. As so bluntly put recently in <a href="http://rubyrogues.com/125-rr-loyalty-and-layoffs/">Ruby Rogues #125 - Loyalty and Layoffs</a>, it is this person's job to maximize shareholder value. If the CEO does not do this, they aren't doing their job, and should be removed by the board of directors. These are the values of a Corporation, a purely capitalistic abstraction, with the purpose of generating wealth for its shareholders.

So here I am, CEO of Three Wise Men Inc., with a fiduciary responsibility to myself as sole shareholder, to shed staff to the point of profitability.

There was my friction. These people, that form the foundation of my value proposition to our customers, that I so fervently and frequently argue are not a commodity, that cannot be bought and sold on the market, needed to be shed in some heartless savage act.

This here to me represents the fundamental difference between a Corporation and a Worker's Cooperative. The values that drive the actions of the CEO.

The values of a Corporation are hierarchical, profit-focused, maximizing shareholder wealth. The values of a Cooperative are democratic equality, sharing, taking care of the needs of the community.

So I find myself having attempted to run a Corporation with the value system of a Cooperative.

Sure, by and large it mostly works. It's very short sighted for a Corporation to neglect its staff in exchange for profitability. Corporations invest in people, not out of the needs of the people themselves, but the need to avoid the cost of re-staffing, retraining, reduced productivity.

It's this alignment of values about which I find myself most excited.

The promise that I can execute, with full responsibility, using my own value system, to the benefit of our staff and customers.

And here's the best part – I'm not alone! Every one of our workers is aligned. Not just doing their job for a paycheque, not just working for the financial benefit of some unseen group of shareholders, but working <em>together</em>, towards all of our <em>common cause</em>, for our <em>customers</em>, as <em>people</em>.

I have frequently referred to software development as a social endeavour. Now, it's in our bones.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[The past year has been exhausting. I've never felt so much like a hamster on a wheel.

This year will mark 8 years into my transition, 5 years into my social transition, 3 years since my last gender affirming surgeries.

I'm very much at peace with my body now. The change came so slowly, I could hardly tell as it happened, but looking back at myself 10 years ago? I was a mess. Gender dysphoria had me over its knee, I was constantly distracted by it, it consumed me. It was a constant buzz at the back of my skull, pulling all my thoughts in towards it.

I did some pretty awful things to myself, the worst of which was letting an herbal supplement regime mushroom out to un-supervised self-medicated HRT. I was buried in shame. I lied to everyone, including myself about it.

Today, if it weren't for the advocacy work that I do, I wouldn't really be thinking about my gender at all. It's no longer a concern. It's even a bit awkward right now to write about it, because I have to dig up how I feel. Is this what cis privilege feels like?

Being comfortable in my felt-gender role (as opposed to my physical being) is a bit further off, but I push against the bounds of this one. Maybe it's the feminist in me. I think that this is a struggle I have in common with many women.

I find myself drawn to communities where the struggle is ongoing, launching the Durham Region chapter of Ladies Learning Code (LLC) was a hallmark event for me here.

Earlier in the year I found my "tribe" at the Agile Coach Camp Canada conference in Cornwall. This set the stage for my courage to start the LLC chapter. It was an amazing event and I learned a lot about myself that weekend. I'd been unable to express why I enjoyed my team coaching engagements until I spent the weekend with so many wonderful coaches who shared that enjoyment.

I feel accepted by the LLC community, by the agile coaching community, and that seems to drop a hand-grenade into my lifetime of internalized transphobia. How this makes me feel is impossible to express in words. Suffice to say, I feel good.

Regular life of course is still a struggle. It's a common struggle though, and I feel better equipped to bear it.

This year marked the launch of my first software service (<a href="https://primr.io" target="_blank">primr.io</a>) in 12 years. I'm excited for it, but I have the same fears as many entrepreneurs - will it be successful, will it survive, will people care about it. 2016 will tell me that.

What I find most interesting though, is that for years I've strived to figure out a product that I could build, and after the turmoil of 2014 what arose seems a merging of my social justice advocacy and my software skills, two worlds I didn't see colliding, yet in hindsight it seems so obvious.

I fear for the social entrepreneurship bubble, it feels a bit like the popular kid in the fickle startup community. Like it was created to capture people with my core values and draw us in to the startup community and its constant search for the new megastar, constantly taunting us with promises of venture capital and government assistance. I have no interest in that endless chase.

Honestly, the reason I have what these folks call a social venture has nothing to do with their bubble and everything to do with my core values.

In the meanwhile though, it's nice at a business level to be in the same room with others that hold these values, more than superficially. Startup practices like honing your pitch and cash management skills are universal and important, so for now it doesn't feel too far wrong to be here. I do anticipate a falling out with the crowd though. That capitalist startup smell is present, and oh so unappealing.

At least nobody has suggested to me so far to offshore my development work. That ought to be an entertaining "conversation" for onlookers.

I still have far too much on my plate. In addition to my business demanding more of my time than it has in 10 years, launching Gender Journeys Durham, joining the CMHA Gender Journeys team in Peterborough, and launching the LLC Durham chapter, I feel like over the past few years I've filled far beyond the extra capacity I've gained with my gender congruence. I need to let go a thing or three, but focusing on the things that bring me the greatest joy will also bring me financial ruin, so I continue to sit on the fence. My latest two  joys at least cover their own costs (CMHA and Ladies Learning Code).

Thus is the lure of a social venture, work that is good for the soul AND pays well. It does still feel like I'm refusing to make this decision doesn't it?

On the family side there's not much change in 2015. I did attend a family picnic hosted by a cousin, none of my immediate family came (that would have been "interesting" - still estranged from my family of origin). Our oldest daughter is slowly re-engaging with us after a year of isolation. Our youngest still struggling to complete high school though she's aging on. Our middle is past the middle of her University undergrad.

My spouse and I continue our journey, still reconciling our relationship, now with my physical changes. That's a rough road, and not one I'm ready to share.

I don't get to see many friends, or grow many acquaintances into friendships, but that's OK. I have a couple friendships that blossomed in 2015 and help keep me energized, and I've always been a quality over quantity person when it came to friendships.

I don't know what 2016 will bring me, but change is not only inevitable but required. My cash position needs to improve, and continuing on my current path isn't going to do it. That's OK though, I think it's going to be fun!]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[There was once a family of beavers who lived in the forest in a quiet valley. They had found a stream and made their home there, a lovely lodge in the small pond that had formed. Food was plentiful, there was work to be done, and they were happy.

Occasionally the beavers would travel to the city to see their raccoon friends, who had their own lovely home and had begun raising their family.

One day, there came a fierce storm, and a pair of old trees in the forest were weakened by the winds. One quiet night, the first tree gave out, fell into the other, and then they both fell onto the beavers' family lodge, and in a flurry of sticks and mud, it was crushed under the water.

The home was sturdy, and beavers do just fine in the water, so the family, a bit rattled, made it to shore and thought about what to do. They consulted their raccoon friends in the nearby city.

"We didn't hear any trees fall. Are you sure that happened?" asked the raccoon family. The beaver family stood, dumbfounded.

"Why don't you just come and live in the city?" asked the raccoon family. The beaver family tried to explain that beavers live in lovely lodges, made of sticks and mud, in the peaceful ponds formed by their dams. Besides, what would they do all day?

"Well, there's plenty of work here! There are so many garbage cans to tip and explore!" The raccoons really enjoyed living in the city, and their enthusiasm showed!

The beaver family tried to explain that there were few trees, and no creeks or streams that would be suitable for a dam. Besides, the raccoons in the city tended to hire mostly other raccoons, for whatever reasons. And while the beavers thought they could pretend to be raccoons for a while, if they were found out, they'd be fired for the deception. And really, they were beavers. Unmatched in their skill of felling trees and building dams. They loved the forest. It was a perfect home for them.

When the beavers left, the raccoons were distraught. They talked about the situation with the other city raccoons. Together they decided that they were responsible for providing work for the beavers, who they felt would really enjoy foraging through the garbage cans. Who wouldn't?! There were such treats to be found!

They wanted to protect the beavers, and felt those mud and stick homes weren't nearly as nice as their solid brick city structures, which would make much better homes for the beavers. They also talked about the forest, it was so dangerous with all those trees!

So the raccoons banded together and decided to burn the forest.

And when the forest was burned, the dams were destroyed.

And when the dams were destroyed, the city was flooded.

As the creatures fled the valley, the raccoon family and beaver family found each other along the long road of refugees.

The raccoon family was optimistic, "Just wait until we get to the city over the hill! It's a lovely place! I hear they have lovely puzzle garbage bins - great for keeping the mind sharp, and filled with the yummiest food imaginable!"

The beaver family sighed, and hoped for a cool stream and lots of trees.

<em>Listen to your neighbours, your friends, your family. Believe them when they tell you what makes them happy. What makes them feel true to themselves. What is hard for them.</em>

<em>There are people who are different from you making beautiful lives in this world. Lives to which they are entitled by their humanity. Lives that look different than yours.</em>

<em>Let's learn to love each other </em>for<em> who we are, instead of </em>despite<em>.</em>

<em>My little writing exercise above was a simple way for me to turn this over in my mind on a quiet Saturday morning. As a software developer, I fully realize it's a "leaky abstraction" but it was fun to write, and I hope that you found it at least a little fun to read. And I do miss my home in the forest where I hope to be again soon with my family, which probably looks different than yours.</em>

<em>----</em>

<em>I realized this is probably more a Fable than a Parable, so I changed the title.</em>]]></content:encoded>

  <title>2016 Big Steps Forward</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Lots of folks have been complaining lately about 2016.

Certainly, as one friend of mine pointed out, as movies and celebrities have become more prominent in our lives, and my impressionable teen years were in the 80's, I've seen a lot of my childhood heroes fall away this year. This trend I'm sure will continue as I age.

But personally, since I significantly shifted my business focus nearly two years ago, 2016 has been one of the most fulfilling to-date.

Professionally, I have found my path forward into more of a consulting role with clients. This has been immensely fulfilling. I didn't realize how much I'd picked up through my years of struggle in my own consultancy. Problems that I stopped seeing entirely because I just reflexively dealt with them. It is still hard to see them, but now I'm developing a reportoire of feedback from others who seem better qualified to put how I help into words.

Perhaps it's my perspective from my work in the trans community, but I see oppressions and micro-aggressions in many places, they are rampant in my industry. Perhaps they are in every industry, perhaps this is simply universal. My view has widened from myself, to other trans people, to people who have chosen careers in software development, to the companies that employ them. Helping folks break down the barriers they put in front of themselves, helping them see past the small shadow they see cast beneath them to the fullness of their capability and humanity. Freeing them to courageously explore new ideas and technologies, develop their craft, this is uniquely rewarding for me.

Personally, we've been nesting in our home up north, improving the property and house. The uniqueness and draw of this life drives me to leap towards it. As I describe to new acquaintances and clients, "I live in a log cabin in the middle of the woods." This is who I am, who I want to be, how I want to live life. Work is fine, but is just a means to this end. This perspective has been freeing. Invigorating.

The Trump presidency may narrow my professional opportunties, if he follows through with his promise and dismantles NAFTA (management consulting is the NAFTA window that allows me to work with companies in the US). Perhaps Canadian companies have started to catch on to this new trend of bringing software skills in-house and growing local teams. I feel like my new perspective will help me locate and close opportunities here, at the very least it has given me the confidence to pursue them.

This holiday season has been one of the most fulfilling over the past 5 years as well. Having our daughters close, minimal family friction, a further glimpse of how our family will grow in the coming years, and having my spouse's parents much closer than ever has made for a fun family filled season. Maybe this rare 10 days (in a row!) at home has inflated my fondness for being here, but it just feels good.

This year marked 5 years into my social gender transition, the time at which I began exclusively presenting to the world in my felt gender. That was an important anniversary. The initial shock of transition has given way to slow growth and self-acceptance. Undoing half a lifetime of dysphoria and male socialization is painstaking. As sure as I was, I didn't realize then how tentative and hesitant my initial steps were in this direction. With each step over the past 5 years the feeling that I'd done the right thing has solidified. Now it's just odd habits and mannerisms and allowing myself to accept the woman I am, in all my geekiness, weird body shape, too-deep voice, and oddly acquired mannerisms.

I feel less fragile now than I ever have. For a few years my professional confidence carried me through the turmoil, but now I feel like my personal confidence is starting to be able to take on some of that burden. I'm not sure it will yet withstand judgement from the family I grew up with, that feels like a race against time, but I'm certainly not up for a race. I won't suffer people in my life who refuse to accept me for who I am, so I am left wondering if we will ever speak again, and wondering if I'll ever have the strength to find out before they're gone. If that's to be, then so be it. Maybe it will be more comforting for them to live with the memory of who I tried to be rather than who I actually am. That is their choice to make, not mine, and I think I've finally stopped feeling responsible for it.

Who knows what the next 5 years holds for me, as I get back on my feet financially, as our children continue to mature, as we try and build a life more on purpose than by how the wind blows us. It feels good.

Life could still capsize us in this little dinghy we've built, but it's nice to float for a while.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>[DRAFT] Getting Started In Software Development</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>More than occasionally, I get asked, "How can I learn programming as a beginner?" I have many thoughts on this, and here is just one of them...</em>

<strong>The Long Road</strong>

When I think about my own path, I've been learning programming since the age of 10. I'll be learning programming today, tomorrow, and again next week. I learned yesterday, and the day before as well.

So ask yourself why you want to learn to program. Because you may be doing it for the rest of your career, and you will think many times throughout, "why did I choose this?!"

Today's electronic devices are mostly programmed by people who started with this same thought, and have taken a wide array of paths. Take comfort in that.

<strong>Labels</strong>

I believe we are experiencing a diversity crisis in this field. Too few voices and life perspectives shaping the devices and software we use every day to live our lives and do our jobs.

People will make assumptions about you, some judgement based on your appearance. If you're a woman. If you're asian. If you're non-binary. If you're heavy. If you're black. These judgements may pigeon-hole you into certain expectations.

Even when you get into this field, you will find yourself judged based on a job title.

You're a woman and a "senior developer". You're black and a "tester". You're asian and a "UX designer". One more label, one more set of judgements about who you are as a professional and as a person.

You are not your labels.

No matter how many labels you wear, some part of you will always be erased behind them.

<strong>Who Are You</strong>

You want to be a software developer? *abracadabra* You're a software developer!

Feel any different? No? But you've already expressed the key trait of a software developer! You want to learn to write software.

As we find our place within our fields, we have to first see ourselves in this field. What kind of software developer do you want to be? I'm not talking about programming languages here, you may not know one yet but you might know that "I'm transgender non-binary and I hate how all the software I use reinforces gender stereotypes!"

Cool! Through your career you will probably use dozens of programming languages and environments to bring that part of yourself into the world through your code.

Find these anchors within yourself, they will transcend the mud you need to wade through as you journey through your career.

Where To Start Learning

Find A Mentor

Write A Shit Ton Of Code, Throw It Out, Write It Again

Find A Community

Publish, Write, Speak]]></content:encoded>

  <title>In Memory of Nancy Diamond</title>
  <link>https://svetzal.wordpress.com/2017/02/12/in-memory-of-nancy-diamond/</link>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[When I was growing up, I didn't have a lot of friends. I had a small circle of friends in high school, and through this small circle of friends we began to congregate at one house, where there was space for us and we were always welcomed. When I first met Nancy, I thought she was "the cool mom", though she'd been just as happy with keeping us away from the kinds of trouble teenagers tend to find I think. That was so long ago, most of my memories are just feelings now.

I knew that Nancy was involved in politics, a professional woman with a degree and leadership skills. She was my earliest exposure to what I believe are the best qualities of feminism. This was so different than my family - my mom was a home maker, I never witnessed her in a leadership role other than being the matriarch of our family. That's OK, but I knew in my heart that wouldn't be my path. Nancy was a capable woman, navigating a man's world, the world I was resigned to (at the time) living within. I didn't know it then, but that boy's view of the world given to me by society was gonna get shattered in my years to come.

I am a transgender woman. As I transitioned 6-8 years ago, I didn't immediately realize how much Nancy had inspired my self-image.

After my business' 10 year anniversary open-house in 2012, which followed my social transition in 2011, I finally felt comfortable telling Nancy how I'd considered her a role model since I was a teenager. Her response was plain and perfectly punctuated: "I was not thinking of myself as a role model; however, I shall just blush appropriately and say thank you."

I had grown up falling into the patriarchy, seeing that men were leaders, believing at some level, despite reading and observing otherwise, that I could lead and conduct my professional self only as a man. I'd seen a tiny bit of how Nancy challenged that, but didn't really understand the depth of it.

As I transitioned, it was Nancy's immediate acceptance and inclusion that gave me the perspective and examples that shape who I am today.

She invited me to join the board of the Business Advisory Centre Durham (BACD), an organization rebuilding itself after some challenges. A place where I could see her at work. She was a regional and a municipal councillor, and I watched how she conducted herself in meetings, in rooms full of men. She knew the rules, held her ground, leaned into the work, and was the first person out the door to grab a glass of water for a presenter when they looked parched. This embodiment of a person driven by compassion for others, drives my understanding of what it is to be a servant leader. She was strong and compassionate and oh so sharp.

She reminded me often that I needed a healthy business as a foundation from which to help others. As I'd say today, you can't pour from an empty cup. She'd look at me with that look when I described my latest venture, talking about apprenticeship, or our code retreats. A look that said "and how will you make money?"

She also reminded me how to go to a meeting. Read the materials ahead of time. Think of questions, look for problems or errors. Throw some rocks at it and see if it holds water. Then go prepared. Rarely a board meeting went by where she didn't find an error in the previous minutes, or a by-laws question.

Nancy was an ally to the LGBTQ community, she went to every flag raising we did in Oshawa against homophobia and transphobia, transgender visibility month, she attended PFLAG galas and donated money to help us in our outreach to help the community. I could tell the groundwork she'd laid, people knew me or of me, knew what things were about. She'd give tips on navigating tricky processes, and she was nearly always there to hug when I arrived. Nancy went out of her way to be an ally for the community, and for me.

Nancy and I were about the same height and had the same shoe size, and thus the same challenges finding clothing in a world that caters to "regular size women" (whatever that means). When I saw myself as too tall, feet too big, feeling bad about my body, un-womanly, Nancy reminded me. Women come in all shapes and sizes, even mine, and every shape holds dignity.

She departed true to her nature. Insisting she was fine, continuing her work, until she wasn't. Then, in a heartbeat, she was gone.

Nancy reminds me that every day on this earth is an opportunity to do good, or do nothing. To improve, or be complacent. To serve others, or to spectate.

I endeavour to do her spirit justice before it is my turn to leave.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>More than occasionally, I get asked, "How can I learn programming as a beginner?" I have many thoughts on this, and here is just one of them...</em>

<strong>The Long Road</strong>

When I think about my own path, I've been learning programming for a very long time. Experience has shown me that I'll be learning programming today, tomorrow, and again next week.

So ask yourself <em>why</em> you want to learn to program. Because you may be doing it for the rest of your career, and you will think many times throughout, "why did I choose this?!"

Today's electronic devices are mostly programmed by people who started with the same thought as you are having, and they have taken a wide array of paths. Take comfort in that. In knowing that there is no "one true path."

Learn something, every day. Write code. Throw it out. Rinse, lather, repeat. Find joy in that cycle. Toss your proudest moments up on Github to show others, and to remember for yourself. Also remember that next week, they may not seem so brilliant, but they are important. They are you in your past, being the best you that you knew how to be in that moment. Be kind to past you. Learn from past you.

You don't need to take a course, you don't need to obtain a certificate or degree, or jump from bootcamp to bootcamp, though those are options that might focus you. You can do this in your evenings and on weekends while you eek out a living elsewise. Decide for yourself why you are choosing this, so that you can answer future you's inevitable question.

George Leonard in The Way of Aikido wrote about the Obsessive, the person so eager to learn that it actually got in the way of their journey. "How long will it take me to master aikido?" To which Leonard says there is only one answer, "How long do you expect to live?"

If you can stay it out, if you find that you enjoy it more than simply being able to do it, know that the world needs you.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I believe we are experiencing a diversity crisis in this field. Too few voices and life perspectives shaping the devices and software we use every day to live our lives and do our jobs.

People will make assumptions about you, some judgement based on your appearance. If you're a woman. If you're asian. If you're non-binary. If you're heavy. If you're black. These judgements may pigeon-hole you into certain expectations.

Even when you get into this field, you will find yourself judged based on a job title.

You're a woman and a "senior developer". You're black and a "tester". You're asian and a "UX designer". One more label, one more set of judgements about who you are as a professional and as a person.

You are not your labels.

No matter how many labels you wear, some part of you will always be erased behind them.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>AI Programmers Will Take Our Jobs!</title>
  <link>https://svetzal.wordpress.com/2017/02/25/ai-programmers-will-take-our-jobs/</link>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[So, this hit my newswires today:

https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg23331144-500-ai-learns-to-write-its-own-code-by-stealing-from-other-programs/

Let the panic begin! Programmer jobs are dead! Cheap programmer labour! All our software dreams are about to come true, for free, and as fast as the supercomputer can deliver them!

Mmmmhmm.

On the surface, this seems pretty reasonable. These days, many programmers will start by googling their problem and then reading what they see on sites like Stack Overflow. Programmers of all levels of experience.

So what are they thinking when they search?

Sometimes I think, "How do I solve this?" I see "answers" presented, pick the one at the top, and effectively copy it.

Sometimes I think, "How have others solved this?" I see "options" presented, check how recently it was discussed, and how well it aligns with my goals, and if it's a fit, effectively copy it.

Sometimes I think, "How have others solved this?" I see "options" presented, check how recently they were discussed, wonder how the differences in the answers came about. I look at different ways the question has been asked, and wonder how the differences in those questions came about. I journey through the humanity of how these things came about. I laugh, I cry, and then finally settle on how I will approach the problem.

You see, the more experience you gain in this field, the more you understand that software development is for the time being a very human endeavour. It requires things like empathy, delight, things we've traditionally characterized as human.

Now, don't get me wrong, I have a lot of experience but when I'm googling how to get some arcane portion of iOS to do something I've never done before, I'm very much a beginner, and I end up doing things that are very trusting of the folks who contribute to Stack Overflow. This is a normal thing, as a beginner I have little ability to reason about that particular corner of the technology landscape. Everybody's a beginner about most things (for large values of most).

What makes people good software developers is more their ability to learn new and different things, because this field is nothing but chaotic change. Accelerating.

So back to AI.  How many years will it be before a computer has the pattern matching capacity of the human brain? How many years before we draw that distinction between having empathy and simulating empathy?

That's how long we have before I fear the obliteration of the software development profession. Heck, it's still in its larval stage, we haven't even seen it's most interesting advancements yet.

And by then, we may well have found that our extraterrestrial search for new life is less interesting than life that evolved in a different way here on earth.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>[DRAFT] Holding Hands</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Oh the tears. When holding hands with my love went from a simple thing we thought nothing of, to an act of defiance, playing hide and seek in a world of hate. Hands once joined now held apart in fear. We are the same pair back then and now, I shed my old skin and was born anew but now we hold hands in secret, tell ourselves stories like we are an old couple now we don't need to be constantly holding hands. But not expressing this simple thing wears the soul and it hurts in a way that these people that hate take righteous pride. Holding hands will we be yelled at? Beaten? Shot? I grew up in a house where one sentiment expressed burned its way into my psyche. That gay people should be lined up against a wall and shot. Statements made offhand, out of ignorance, whether held with conviction or not, the image in my young mind burns even now. So we don't hold hands, my love and I, and it hurts not only us but the world in which we live. The media narrative on love, polished cisgender and heteronormative, having become so many peoples window to the world outside their televisions and computers, is not true, and occasionally we catch a glimpse like this, or what I know will be an outpouring of support on this post, on this Facebook where that corporation has chosen to assemble your feed to happen to see my words, and you, the humans on the other side of their keyboards will pour your humanity in.&nbsp;

  <title>What is a Hacker?</title>

  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[This weekend I attended a "hackathon" and was surrounded by folks who didn't really understand the word hacker. They struggled to get through the pejorative meaning to which&nbsp;it has so popularly become attached. I've long been a fan of IETF RFC 1392, in which the fine folks at the Internet Engineering Task Force (those hackers largely responsible for the early formation of the Internet and its mechanics)&nbsp;attempted to formalize a definition of the word.

As an old, grey-haired, life-long hacker, let me lend my perspective to it here.

A hacker is someone who delights in the construction, deconstruction, or reconstruction of things in the world around us. Those things might be abstract (software, philosophy, business, ideas), they might be technological (electronics, materials), they really could be anything. The activity that is hacking is the sometimes careful, often clumsy, always playful journey.

You see, hacking gets its name from this <i>clumsy playfulness</i>.

We find delight when we discover something new. This may be a new way to put two things together that we've partially or wholly disassembled. It may be something we tripped over trying to create something else.

We find frustration when we don't fully understand what&nbsp;something is. We turn it around, try increasingly silly things to align our mental model of it with the observations we make. If we solve the puzzle, find the right mental model, discover truth, the frustration is shoved&nbsp;aside by elation and pure joy. If we don't, we try differently, we talk to others, and we learn from it..

The pejorative meaning has stemmed from when people hack for nefarious outcomes. When they take the results of their hacking and do harm. It is this activity, after hacking has been done, that may be&nbsp;harmful or illegal. Though these days some companies would make the act of hacking itself illegal to protect their secrets.

There is much to be discussed about a society that seeks to transfer the pursuit of knowledge from a personal activity for the benefit of human beings, to a profit-seeking activity for the benefit of a business. This may sound like an odd statement from an entrepreneur, but this is a long and tedious topic best approached with healthy amounts of liquor and&nbsp;when your optimism reserves are running high.

&nbsp;

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I've been coaching other teams for over a year now (I spent 15 years coaching my own teams), but I still have a small software development shop bubbling behind me building products, where I have an apprentice and, occasionally, interns.

I can continue to manage the culture there, refine what I established with our larger consultancy in years past. Compare and contrast it to what I see in my coaching engagements. Also, unlike my coaching engagements, I can blog about it!

Last week I prefixed our Monday stand up with a talk about entropy, the essence of which I will present here. It gets a little philosophical, so grab yourself a cuppa.

<h2>Chaos Creeps</h2>

The world creeps towards chaos and entropy. The wind blows the leaves from the trees and scatters them in a mess. Our kitchen at home accumulates garbage, dirty dishes, recycling. Our pets find a piece of cardboard and shred it on the living room floor.

It happens in our code too when we are not careful.

Think about our life as a software developer. People come to us with scattered, unformed ideas in which we seek patterns and order. The technologies we use sometimes elude our understanding (happened to us this week with some sharp corners in cross-browser CSS3 flexbox) so we wander blindly looking to understand. Writing tentative code to build that understanding.

So here we are, a codebase full of exploration, of what was asked for, of what the market might need, of what we might understand. Pulling us in too many directions. Then add a couple people to the mix and we start dealing with multiple interpretations of those directions, multiple problem solving approaches, multiple mental models of roughly the same concepts, half in someone's brain and half in the code repository.

It's a wonder anything works, right?

<h2>The Professional On The Job</h2>

So here is the thing. As the professional on the job each of us is expected to spend each and every keystroke we make towards taming that chaos.

This involves talking to each other, while pairing and while exploring ideas with stakeholders. Using a source control system to isolate ideas and experiments. Writing tests first so that we have at least two perspectives on every line of code we write.

Sound familiar? It should. These are core activities in a modern, healthy, software development practice.

It is not your job to crank out code, it is your job to crank out the <em>"correct"</em> code in as <em>small a quantity</em> as possible. The "correct" code is the code that solves the <em>actual</em> problem.

Look at how much code you wrote this week. How much did you throw out? How much is covered by automated tests?

Throw out a lot of code. Writing it helped you understand the problem you are solving, the underlying technologies, the bugs in your communication.  Don't get attached to that code. <strong>The value is not in the code.</strong> Then, while the learning is fresh in your mind, you will write a better implementation, solving something closer to the actual problem. Code worthy of your talent, worthy of the code base, worthy in the world. Commit that to your repo. Delete the rest, and revel in what you learned from it.

<h2>WTFs</h2>

<h3>You do use source-control, right?</h3>

Frequently I come across freelancers who don’t use source control. It amazes me. I just can’t imagine picking apart the chaos without seeing how it evolved, lifting apart the threads, zooming in on the nugget we half missed, pulling it forward to polish it off and commit it. Maybe they think their work is mundane enough to have an immunity to chaos (note above my CSS3 flexbox surprises). Maybe they never have to maintain the code they write because it became “done”, “shipped”, abandoned.

<h3>Surprise!</h3>

The chaos doesn’t always present itself right away, described in my “Chaos in the Matryoshka” post from years ago. Sometimes you find you were walking straight into it all along. Today I reverted 4 merges along our main branch in our current product, erasing 2 days worth of our work. It had to be done. The code was worthless. Sunk cost. What we deleted would have cost us weeks to maintain. What we learned will save us weeks knowing the bad path.

<h3>Incomplete thoughts</h3>

Especially early in projects, your code accumulates a number of half finished patterns, things on their way towards an idea you had. Then you have a better idea and more things are on their way to the new idea. You weren’t sure it was going to work out, so you held back so you could get some screens in front of stakeholders for timely discussion. On about the 3rd or 4th pattern things click and you apply it back to the other areas, and realize you can improve it, now you’re juggling 7 or 8 things that <em>almost</em> fit the ideal in your head, codified differently in the codebase. Then toss another person or two in that mix. Chaos, eh?

This can be one of the most insidious things to tame on a team. Alignment with each other takes time. When working remotely it takes longer. Pair programming is your single best tactic for dealing with this, and you can juggle the pairs so that the ideas spread as the pairs talk to each other. Pair and bring the threads together, between yourselves and in the code.

<h2>Every. Single. Keystroke.</h2>

The chaos naturally creeps in, you can’t stop it. You’re writing code to solve a shifting problem, in a shifting team, in a language that’s a work-in-progress, using frameworks that are a work-in-progress, in an editor that’s a work-in-progress, on an operating system that’s a work-in-progress, on a computer that you’re likely to replace in a couple years.

You are a leaf on the wind.

Every keystroke you make <em>must</em> tame the chaos.

The alternative is ultimately to be buried in your technical debt, all those little untied threads, those "I will fix this later"s, those "I don't have time right now"s.]]></content:encoded>
